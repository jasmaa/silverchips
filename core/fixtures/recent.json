Sure, maybe it's just a means of transportation, a way to get from point A to point B as quickly as possible. But for some students, the car is a canvas, and the bumper is the surest way of expressing themselves to the outside world. In the style of \"Humans of New York,\" these are the bumper stickers of Blair.\n\n<sco:embed type=\"image\" id=20993/><b>John Gorman:</b> the unafraid sports fan\n\nJohn Gorman is a senior at Blair who just appreciates a solid bumper sticker.\n\n\"My favorite is probably the Orioles one, it's a cool bumper sticker. It's the biggest, it really sticks out more than the other ones, and I just really like the color orange. People definitely like to rat on the Ravens and the Orioles. My dad grew up in Baltimore and my grandparents are big sports fans in Baltimore, so we prefer the Baltimore sports teams over the Washington sports teams and we're not afraid to show it.\"\n\n\"I like having them on there. I think a car without bumper stickers is kind of stupid, because it spices the road up, you're like, 'oh, that's cool,' looking across the lanes and seeing cool stuff. It's kind of like, who you are. A lot of my bumper stickers are kind of specific to a person. They just kind of show my family and my beliefs. Like the Takoma Park sticker, which for me represents the greatest city in America.\"\n\n<sco:embed type=\"image\" id=20991/><b>Nate Blower:</b> the reluctant bumper\n\nNate Blower is a senior at Blair who's not a big fan of bumper stickers. Okay, maybe small tasteful ones. Maybe.\n\n\"You should ask my parents about why I have bumper stickers. I didn't put them on. They did it to express themselves, I guess. I mean, I'm a fan of like one or two bumper stickers. I like the Obama ones, but the other ones I don't really like that much. Except the one that says 'Ski the East.' I'm a big fan of skiing.\n\nWhen I get my own car, I'd probably put up like one or two bumper stickers. If I go to a college maybe I'll use a bumper sticker to let me park on campus. Or, like, sometimes to go to a dump and dump off trash you need a special bumper sticker on your car. So I'd use that one.\n\nAs far as expression goes, your bumper isn't really important, but it is a place, I guess. I might put up a bumper sticker, but it would have to be a tasteful one, not a very big one, not a very in your face one. Just a nice small bumper sticker. It's distracting when they're big and in your face. I don't understand why you have to do that. Some people cover their entire cars with weird sayings. I don't like that.\"\n\n<sco:embed type=\"image\" id=20992/><b>Conor Clark:</b> the Obama Mama\n\nConor Clark is a senior at Blair who wants people to know about him and his opinions after just one glance at his bumper.\n\n\"I've got a couple stickers from my moms business. She works for First Book, a nonprofit in D.C. that's working towards lowering the education gap between low and high income families. I've got several anti-Trump bumper stickers. They're wonderful, mostly 'cause, f*** Trump, right? I also have an 'Obama Mama' sticker. I think that's the crowning glory of my bumper stickers right now. I am truly the Obama Mama.\n\nI started out with bumper stickers because I got my family's old car with a couple already on it, but then I kept on finding more bumper stickers that I wanted on my car, so I kept adding them. I see things and just think, 'Wow, I want this to be something that I share with other people.'\n\nThere's no expectation that people are going to change their beliefs because of a sticker on my car, but you can definitely form an opinion based on bumper stickers. You can look at a person's bumper stickers and those are the things that they want to express about themselves to other people in a public place. Everybody sees that, random people see that.\"\n\nBaltimore sports fan, Obama Mama, or just local dump patron, people can form an opinion or at least an image of a person based on the stickers they have on their bumper.

Hoy estaremos examinando tres pel\u00edculas para ver en detalle c\u00f3mo los Latinos son protagonizados.\n\nUna de las pel\u00edculas m\u00e1s reconocidas por estudiantes es <i>West Side Story</i>. La trama de esta historia tiene que ver con la rivalidad que existe entre una pandilla Americana y otra Puertorrique\u00f1a. Cuando nos enfocamos en las caracter\u00edsticas que componen a los personajes de la pandilla Puertorrique\u00f1a, primeramente es notable de que son presentados como inmigrantes que son v\u00edctimas de prejuicios por el hecho de no haber nacido en los Estados Unidos. Tal cosa nos lleva al primer problema que tiene que ver con que los Latinos son presentados como personas que siempre tienen problemas con su estatus legal en este pa\u00eds o la idea de que nunca tienen documentaci\u00f3n legal. El segundo estereotipo m\u00e1s grande que existe con este grupo de personas es el ser presentados con acentos. Los Latinos en esta pel\u00edcula tienen acentos que los diferencian a los dem\u00e1s y tal a\u00f1adiendo a una imagen falsa de c\u00f3mo se caracterizan los Latinos en este pa\u00eds.  \n<sco:embed type=\"image\" id=20984/>\nLa segunda pel\u00edcula que quiero discutir se trata de <i>Maid in Manhattan</i>, con la protagonista principal, Jennifer Lopez. La historia trata de una Latina, quien es trabajadora de hotel y que por circunstancias tiene que esconder su identidad verdadera y luego termina enamorada de un hombre de nivel social alto. El primer problema con esta pel\u00edcula no es el hecho de que la Latina tiene como papel tal trabajo, pues es uno que se hace honradamente. El problema se encuentra en que las Latinas la mayor\u00eda de veces no son presentadas con trabajos de alta importancia en la sociedad como en \u00e1reas pol\u00edticas igual a los hombres. Adicionalmente, siendo trabajadora de hotel significa que no gana mucho dinero, y el hecho de que su personaje se enamora de un hombre rico crea una idea negativa sobre qu\u00e9 tipos de hombres las Latinas suelen enamorarse.\n\nNo solo son las mujeres Latinas representadas falsamente, sino tambi\u00e9n los hombres Latinos. Este hecho nos lleva a la Revoluci\u00f3n Mexicana, en donde Pancho Villa, un general, firm\u00f3 un contrato con <i>Mutual Film Corporation</i> en donde permiti\u00f3 que grabaran las guerras. De esta ocurrencia deriva la representaci\u00f3n de hombres Latinos como personajes violentos. Un ejemplo de esto es la pel\u00edcula <i>Scarface</i>. Esta trata de un Cubano que estuvo encarcelado antes de emigrar a los Estados Unidos, quien recurre a la violencia despu\u00e9s de haber emigrado, y gana poder y riquezas. Adem\u00e1s de ser un personaje Latino violento, su papel incluye la involucraci\u00f3n de drogas. Esta presentaci\u00f3n agrega a la percepci\u00f3n de que los hombres Latinos llevan una vida de crimen.\n<sco:embed type=\"image\" id=20985/>\nEntre los a\u00f1o del 2010 al 2013, los Latinos comprometieron el 2.3 por ciento de los directores de pel\u00edculas, 2.2 por ciento de los productores y el 6 por ciento de los escritores. Estos son n\u00fameros extremadamente peque\u00f1os, que llevan a la pregunta, \u00bfQui\u00e9n es responsable sobre la inundaci\u00f3n de estereotipos hacia los Latinos? Aparte de crear una imagen negativa sobre los Latinos, estos eserotipos causan efectos negativos en este grupo de personas. Un estudio conducido por <i><a href=\"http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/0146167202288010\">Sage Journals</a></i> encontr\u00f3 de que las Latinas sol\u00edan a desempe\u00f1arse menos que sus compa\u00f1eros de otras razas en ex\u00e1menes dado a los estereotipos contra su raza, effectos no causados por los estereotipos hacia su g\u00e9nero. <i><a href=\"http://www.nhmc.org/sites/default/files/LD%20NHMC%20Poll%20Results%20Sept.2012.pdf\">National Hispanic Media Coalition</a></i> condujo un estudio nacional en donde se concluy\u00f3 de que las personas expuestas a impresiones negativas acerca de los Latinos ya sea en la noticias o en entretenimiento, son influenciados a pensar negativamente de ellos.\n\nLos Latinos tienden a ser protagonizados con los mismos estereotipos. Son presentados con problemas por ser inmigrantes y con hablar ingl\u00e9s con un accento, siendo presentados pocas veces como profesionales. Aparte de esto, la identidad de un Latino es inventado. Sus im\u00e1genes en las pel\u00edculas muchas veces tienen que ver con el hecho de que son pobres o que no viven una vida decente. Sus personalidades son falsificadas de ciertas maneras al igual en c\u00f3mo se miran y visten.\n<sco:embed type=\"image\" id=20986/>\nEn resumen, estas tres pel\u00edculas s\u00f3lo son una fracci\u00f3n peque\u00f1a de todas las dem\u00e1s que se unen en tener personajes que contribuyen a los estereotipos. La pr\u00f3xima vez que veas una pel\u00edcula, presta atenci\u00f3n meticulosamente a los papeles que representan los Latinos y haz algo para aumentar el conocimiento sobre este problema. Entre m\u00e1s es ignorado, las consecuencias aumentan al igual que el n\u00famero de v\u00edctimas.", "section": 37, "cover": null, "authors": [891], "tags": []}}, {"model": "core.story", "pk": 13512, "fields": {"created": "2017-03-08T02:12:00Z", "modified": "2017-12-19T15:35:36.842Z", "title": "Get Out gets real", "description": "Jordan Peele creates a movie that perfectly combines horror and comedy", "publishable": true, "published": 0, "views": 0, "lead": "This comedy-thriller will keep you on your toes while teaching you a thing or two about race relations. \"Get Out\" has an eerily realistic  feeling that makes the creepy characters all the more frightening, making it a must-see for 2017.", "text": "This comedy-thriller will keep you on your toes while teaching you a thing or two about race relations. \"Get Out\" has an eerily realistic  feeling that makes the creepy characters all the more frightening, making it a must-see for 2017.\n\nThe movie begins as Chris (Daniel Kaluuya) and his girlfriend, Rose (Allison Williams), head to the suburbs to meet Rose's family. When they get there, Chris immediately  notices that something is off with the family. The black groundskeeper and maid, Walter (Marcus Henderson) and Georgina (Betty Gabriel) are both  out of place and uncomfortable around him. Rose's brother Jeremy (Caleb Landry Jones) assesses Chris' physical abilities and tries to wrestle him at dinner, making things even more awkward. He continues to have odd encounters with white people, from being hypnotized by Rose's mom (Catherine Keener), to finding an old friend married to an old white woman, Chris realizes something's up and tries to escape from the home before it is too late.  Unlike typical, oblivious horror movie characters, Chris logically reacts to keep himself alive. \n<sco:embed type=\"image\" id=20990/> \n\nPart of the genius of the movie is that it expertly combines horror with the comedy. Chris' friend, Rod (Lil Rel Howery), provides comedic relief as he watches Chris' dog and connects the dots of what is going on with Rose's family . He warns Chris to stay away from the  white suburb, or else he'll become a \"brainwashed sex slave\". Though spliced with humor, the horror element is never lost. The anxiety grows as the Armitage family gathering commences and Chris meets a bunch of old, racist couples. An old woman asks about his sexual abilities, another feels his muscles, and a man comments on black being \"in fashion\". The Armitages size up Chris then hold a veritable bidding war for him, providing a parallel to slavery. Slavery was abolished, but racism continues to persist, and black people are still  treated as the lesser race, like how the Armitages treat Chris.The movie also alludes to the current situation of police brutality against black people.  \n<sco:embed type=\"image\" id=20988/>\n\nThe quality cinematography, solid soundtrack, and realistic acting is a refreshing change of pace from recent cheesy horror films.. The cinematography was seamless and creative, making the movie fun to watch. And the music added to the uneasy tone in the Armitage house which augmented the horror film feel of \"Get Out\". Jordan Peele's writing was comedic, as always, and addressed the many levels of racism.

Stay up to date with the selected film every week to be immersed in some awesome old movies.\n\n<i>Whale Rider</i> is the story of Paikea (Keisha Castle-Hughes), a Maori girl who must fight for her rights and for her culture. According to legend, the Maori came to New Zealand from the island of Hawaii on the backs of whales. This awesome culture has been steadily deteriorating, and Paikea's tribe is held together only by her grandfather, Koro (Rawiri Paratene).\n\nKoro is looking for his successor as tribal chieftain, someone to revitalize the town and to encourage the youth of the village to be true to their roots. He doesn't believe in his granddaughter Paikea's ability to lead the tribe because she is a girl. She must prove her worth to him over the course of the movie through her interactions with other Maori and by showing inner strength.\n\nThis movie is a great study of a culture and a people little-known to many Americans. The Maori are a people known for their bug-eyed, long-tongued expressions when going to war. What isn't so well known is the group's struggles with contemporary issues like sexism, drugs and alcohol, all of which are tearing at the fabric of Maori society. This movie is strikingly accurate in its representation of the ethnic group. While most of the main characters are played by actors from New Zealand, all of the extras are actual Maori people, and they were instrumental in the creation of the film, making sure everything was true.\n<sco:embed type=\"image\" id=20997/>\nAnother thing that makes this film so unique is the setting. Filmed on location in New Zealand, the ocean cliffs and grassy fields make for a gorgeous backdrop. Camera shots of real whales swimming through the ocean, exuding size and power, add to both the beauty and suspense of the story. All of these natural aspects are punctuated by music played by real Maori shell flutes, a haunting instrument that is effective for such a coming-of-age tale.\n\nOne final piece of the puzzle that is <i>Whale Rider</i> is the acting. Castle-Hughes is amazing in her debut role as Paikea, showing remarkable talent and poise for a first-time child actor. Paratene is menacing, glaring and beating his chest like a real Maori warrior, and sending chills of fear down the spines of viewers.\n\n<i>Whale Rider</i> is unlike most modern blockbuster movies. The lilting soundtrack and slow panning shots of nature don't lend themselves to popcorn and texting while glancing occasionally up at the screen. Be immersed in the beauty of Maori culture and New Zealand, identify with Paikea in her struggle for equality and culture, and get ready to gasp at one of the coolest climaxes in any movie ever.

Pole vaulter Deeya Garg also went to states as the Blazers' sixth qualifier. \n\nBrane-Wright considered the Blazers' season to be a success, both on an individual and team level. She said that the key to her success in the 1600m run was \"taking indoor track a lot more seriously,\" as in past seasons she viewed it as training for outdoor track.\n\nAlthough no boys from Blair's team qualified for the state meet, several turned in strong performances at the 4A West region meet. The 4x200m relay team took fifth and the 4x400m relay team took sixth place. High jumper Perry Beamer placed seventh after clearing the 5'7 bar, while Chris Butler took tenth in the 55m run with a blazing time of 6.85 seconds.\n\nBlair's success on the track came despite injuries to two of its top athletes, seniors Dominic Massimino and Thierry Siewe Yanga. Both Massimino and Yanga were top performers in the 800m run, as they both were members of last year's outdoor track state champion 4x800m relay team, and Yanga was the individual 800m state champion. \"Those athletes were the soul of the team. I know they worked really hard to get back on track for spring season,\" Beamer said. According to Beamer, Yanga and Massimino would have both had good chances to qualify for the indoor track state meet.\n\nBrane-Wright noted that multiple athletes stepped up for the indoor track team that may not have been expected to coming into the season. In particular, she mentioned freshman Sadie Cheston-Harris, who sacrificed for the sake of the team by coming to states and serving as an alternate for the 4x400m relay team. Beamer also identified Casey as an athlete who exceeded expectations.\n\nOn the team side, the Blazers finished high in the standings at several meets. Both the boys and the girls teams finished in ninth at the Montgomery County meet. In addition to a solid postseason, the Blazers enjoyed success throughout the winter. They often finished in the top five of meets, each of which included at least 15 competing teams.\n\nLuckily for the Blazers, they will not have to wait until next year to continue their triumphs on the track. The outdoor track season is already underway, and with the return of Yanga and Massimino along with several athletes who played other sports during the winter, the Blazers look to put forth another good season in the spring.\n\n<i>Note: Morgan Casey is a photographer for Silver Chips Online.

He founded \"Negro History Week\" in 1926 and it was later expanded to Black History Month. Woodson's aim was to encourage the historical celebration of African-Americans and black people in America. He founded the Association for the Study of African-American Life and History to further this ambition. All around the world, country and at Blair specifically, this goal has come to fruition through a variety of mediums, among them Blair's yearly Sankofa show. \n<sco:embed type=\"image\" id=20900/>\n<b>Why Black History Month?</b>\n\nBlack History Month is a time to celebrate black culture and history, which has had an immeasurable impact on America and the world, while acknowledging the hardships the black community has faced. Many feel that schools do not teach enough about black history and that isn't dealt with often enough in school. Black History Month is the perfect opportunity to make up for lost time. \"It's important that we take some time out of the year to focus on black history because sometimes we brush past it. Having a whole month is a great time for people to learn about people who have done amazing things that you might not know about,\" sophomore Zakaria Gordon explains.\n\nOthers think that the time of year is irrelevant and black culture should be embraced year-round, but February gives people a forum to do so. \"Any time of the year is a good time to celebrate black people, but Black History Month is a good time for people to specifically talk about the history and culture of black people,\" senior Niarah Jackson remarks thoughtfully. Black History Month, to many, including Kenneth Smith, African-American Studies and Sociology teacher, is not as effective as it could be because it is too short. \"Though Blair does a decent job of acknowledging Black History Month, I don't think celebrating for one month is effective -- not here at Blair, not in our county, not anywhere,\" Smith stated firmly. \n\nAs the English Department Chair at Blair, Vickie Adamson believes it is important for black history to be celebrated for its richness and depth, rather than the shallower aspects that seem to draw attention today, especially in pop culture. \"Today, we celebrate rappers discussing misogynistic and profane things. Even if you like rap, and I do, it's not the essence of black art. It's not representative of the extent of black contribution to the artistic world,\" Adamson remarks. \n\nGordon agrees with Adamson's point, especially due to the prejudice black people face in today's society. \"Black people are attacked both in the media and literally. To talk about our culture, real history and things that have happened enables us to relate to what has happened to other groups of people. Black people are more than hip hop, rap, thugs and gangsters. Our culture is important,\" Gordon states passionately. \n\n<b> Celebrating black history at Blair</b>\n\nMany Blazers celebrate black culture and history through the show Sankofa, an educational and entertaining performance directed by English teacher Michelle Edwards, which includes dancing, singing, poetry and speeches relating to black history and culture. The name comes from a mythical bird that can fly forward while looking backwards, a symbol for how one can move forward while still reminiscing about the past. This year, Sankofa was performed on February 10 and 11, and included performances of poetry by Maya Angelou, a Beyonce dance routine and songs by James Brown and Tina Turner. \n\nIn the classroom, on the other hand, Black History Month is not especially noted.  Some students would prefer to learn more about black culture in their regular classes, as all cultures should be represented in those classes as well. \"In our social studies classes we should have a unit about black history and all the oppression and hardships we have overcome. I would really appreciate having that,\" junior Troy Daniels explains. Instead of focusing exclusively on other cultures, he would like to learn a bit about his own.\n\nSeveral Blazers would like to see lessons about black history made more accessible. Gordon believes that Sankofa should be performed over a longer period of time, so that the show can reach a larger amount of people. Smith and Adamson push for a more involved curriculum in English classes, to further expose students to black culture. Jackson would like to see Blair adopt a Sankofa or Black History Month-themed Open Mic that honors black artists. \n\nSmith pushes for a more inclusive celebration, where less-known figures are acknowledged during Black History Month, and throughout the year. Although Martin Luther King Jr. and Rosa Parks made history-altering contributions to our society, others should also be recognized. \"I would like homage paid to the unsung heroes -- for example, Bayard Rustin who is never mentioned, who is instrumental -- he was in MLK's ear but we never hear about him. The same happens with most women activists,\" Smith explains. \n\nAlthough Black History Month is an informative time of year with events like Sankofa, and the inclusion of black history in classes, it's important to remember the reason behind the celebration. This month is a time to reflect on a long struggle to keep black culture and tradition alive through centuries of oppression and mistreatment. \n\n<i>Editor's note: Sankofa is directed Michelle Edwards is the Silver Chips Online advisor</i>", "section": 9, "cover": null, "authors": [909], "tags": []}}, {"model": "core.story", "pk": 13516, "fields": {"created": "2017-03-01T04:11:00Z", "modified": "2017-12-19T15:35:36.986Z", "title": "Trump round-up: January - February 2017", "description": "Immigration ban, secretary of education, alternative facts and resignation", "publishable": true, "published": 0, "views": 0, "lead": "President Donald Trump was elected to office on Nov. 9, 2016 and sworn into office on Jan. 20 2017.

Silver Chips Online posts this summary to provide readers with a forum for discussion</i> \n\nPresident Donald Trump was elected to office on Nov. 9, 2016 and sworn into office on Jan. 20 2017. In just over a month of presidency, he has instituted many policies directly affecting Blair's students and their families. \n\n<b> Jan. 20 - \"Alternative facts\" </b>\nIn regards to Trump's inauguration, White House Press Secretary Sean Spicer, claimed that the crowd was the \"largest ever\" and that those who dissented were trying to remove support from Trump's cause. He had no proof to back up either statement: as shown through aerial photos from President Obama's first and President Trump's inaugurations, the crowd at the former was clearly larger. \n\nThese \"alternative facts\", a term coined by Conway in a CNN interview, are a reference to Spicer's untrue remarks about the crowd size. Interviewer Chuck Todd countered, saying that \"Alternative facts are not facts. They are falsehoods.\"\n\n<b>  Jan. 27 - Immigration ban </b>\nOn Jan. 27th, Trump signed an executive order that effectively instituted an immigration ban, banning refugee travel between the US and seven Muslim-majority countries (Libya, Sudan, Syria, Yemen, Iran, Iraq, and Somalia). VISA-holding citizens and residents were also detained in other countries, separated from their families. After numerous lawsuits, federal courts granted nation-wide stays, suspending enforcement of the executive order and allowing travel to resume, while the White House tried to file an appeal. \n\nAs an immigrant, junior Iyanu Bishop finds the act to be senseless and an act designed to bring down marginalized groups in the United States. \"I'm first generation Jamaican and Trinidadian, my family and I, and my friends in a similar situation could all be affected. He's playing on stereotypes that get immigrants persecuted and killed, getting people of color to live in fear,\" Bishop said. \n\nIn defense of the immigration ban, Conway referred to the nonexistent \"Bowling Green Massacre.\" The massacre was allegedly perpetrated by Iraqi refugees, but was found to not exist at all.  Instead, in 2011, two Iraqi nationals living in Bowling Green, Ky. after a failed attempt to send money and explosives overseas to terrorist organization al-Qaeda. Conway faced severe backlash and later admitted to her mistake in a tweet, saying \"Honest mistakes abound.\"\n\n<b>  Feb. 7 - Secretary of Education, Betsy DeVos </b>\nThe Senate confirmed Betsy DeVos as the Secretary of Education on Feb. 7. For the first time in history, Vice President Mike Pence casted the tie-breaking vote as two Republicans defected. During her hearing, she seemed to be unfamiliar with Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA), an act that ensures children with disabilities still receive a high-quality education. DeVos is widely known, and widely mocked for supporting gun use in schools for defense against \"grizzlies.\"\n\nJunior Michael Yin expressed his dislike and worry for Devos' career as Secretary. \"We do a lot with education policy in county and state SGA. The biggest concern for our student government was Betsy Devos. I don't know if she knows what she is doing, but so far it is not looking good,\" Yin said. \n\n<b> Feb. 13 - Michael Flynn's Resignation</b>\nTrump appointed retired Lieutenant Michael Flynn as National Security Advisor, a position which does not require Senate confirmation. On Feb. 13, Flynn resigned citing phone call mishaps. Flynn admitted he misinformed Vice President Mike Pence in regards to phone calls with a Russian diplomat, Sergey I. Kislyak, and sincerely apologized in his resignation letter. Trump's first replacement candidates did not accept the appointment; the candidate he ended up appointing Lieutenant Herbert Raymond McMaster. \n\n<b> Feb. 22 - Revocation of Federal Guidelines for Transgender Students </b>\nThe Trump Administration revoked President Obama's issued protections for transgender students. The previous guidelines explained that the Obama Administration viewed denying transgender students access to the bathroom of their identity as a violation of Title IX, the law banning sex discrimination in programs and activities receiving federal funds. \n\nPrevious guidance was revoked so that the Trump administration could \"further and more completely consider the legal issues involved,\" delegating this policy to the states.

In class he looked for the big picture and pursued topics further. Early on the morning of January 31, however, Oliveira took his own life. He is survived by his mother and father, his older brother and his younger sister.\n \nBy going through Oliveira's texts, his family believes his actions may have been accidental as a part of a <a href=\"http://www.gaspinfo.com/en/choking.html\">choking game</a>, in which people try to suffocate themselves to reach a kind of momentary euphoria. In an email, Romulo Oliveira, Isaque's father, informed friends that he and his family believe Isaque was participating in this game. \"After further investigation on his phone messages and computer chats history by his brother there is evidence that he had participated in a deadly game (probably the cause of his death) called the choking game or the suffocating challenge as some teenagers call it,\" Oliveira wrote.\n <sco:embed type=\"image\" id=21013/>\nPrincipal Renay Johnson says that Isaque's family wanted to make sure that people know what happened to Oliveira so that the same does not happen to them. \"His brother at the time said 'We want kids to know. We want boys to know that it's okay to ask for help, to not suffer in silence,'\" she says. Following Isaque's death and her conversations with his family, Johnson also contacted a school parent who is a psychologist and who sent her information both on suicide and the so-called choking game.\n\nAlthough he often kept to himself, Isaque was a very good friend to many Blazers. Many fellow alumni from nearby Pinecrest Elementary School and Eastern Middle School knew him for years. \"He was more of a person that was for everyone else than for himself, so I think he would want everyone to have him in the back of his thoughts but still move on with their lives,\" junior Jason Amboo, a friend of Isaque's who met him in elementary school said. \"He was never really about attention,\" junior Katherine Tran agrees.\n \nOliveira enjoyed hanging out, playing video games and having fun with his friends. Tran was one of Oliveira's close friends and appreciated him for always saying what was on his mind and for being himself. \"I thought that it was really cool that he would say whatever he wanted and didn't really care what people think,\" Tran explains.\n \nIn the classroom, Oliveira was often quiet, but when he did speak, he did not shy away from asking important questions and providing insightful comments. According to English teacher Katherine Fliakas, who taught Oliveira for this school year's first semester, one of the important things that he brought to class was his inquisitive nature. \"That 'But what else?' or 'Why?' That pushing for something more,\" describes Fliakas.\n \nBeyond school, Isaque had big dreams. He considered being a professional fighter or working for his father's Brazilian hair extension business Hair Brazil, according to his counselor Rachel Greene.  \"He kept looking beyond high school,\" Greene says.  He also thought more broadly about life.  \"Isaque had a lot of big ideas about the world.  He was very philosophical and intellectual, but in a way that he was still figuring out for himself,\" Fliakas adds.  In fact, Philosophy was one of the classes on Oliveira's schedule for this semester.\n \nThe loss of Isaque Oliveira is a tragedy that struck at the heart of the Blair community.  He will be dearly missed by friends, family, and all of Montgomery Blair High School.\n \n<b>Getting help</b>\n \nIn the wake of Oliveira's death, Johnson brought in psychologists and counselors to help students.  In addition, Blair has a school psychologist that comes every Monday from 10 a.m. to 2 p.m. with whom students can request an appointment through the counseling office.\n \nAdditionally, Fliakas assures that teachers are always there for their students. \"If a student is ever going through a hard time and they feel like people don't understand, or they're not sure what to do, I just want all students to know that their teachers care,\" she says.  Fliakas suggests that if students do not feel comfortable directly approaching a teacher with their feelings, they can also write an email or a note.  Greene also emphasizes that staff members are available for students and want to help them. \"Students might feel they have nobody to talk to and nobody to come to with their problems or their feelings.  We, the counselors, are always here,\" Greene says on behalf of the Blair counseling department.\n \nWhether a teacher or a counselor or another staff member, Blair is full of adults ready and eager to help students, and there is always someone to listen and provide support. \n \n<i>If you or a friend is struggling with depression or suicidal urges, please seek help.

Saxophonist Zach Wathen  is a 2016 Blair alumnus and bassist Jonas Farah-Bumstead is homeschooled. The bands Debt Department and XK Scenario opened for Frailboys and Swan Song. The two headliners are wildly different in almost every way, but managed to draw equal interest and excitement from the crowd. Both groups exploded onto the local music scene in the last month or two, and this was the first public performance by Frailboys, the newer of the two groups. \n\nSwan Song gained popularity through word of mouth and a string of performances at Blair's open-mics, although the band has yet to officially release a song. They've been able to draw sizeable crowds to both of the shows they've done so far through their professional sound and the fusion of a variety of genres (rock, jazz and funk) into their songs. A five-person group, Swan Song seems like an average high school band, but they have a unique sound and vibe anyone can dance to.\n<sco:embed type=\"image\" id=21015/>\nThe group Frailboys has blown up throughout Blair and the Delaware/Maryland/Virginia (DMV) area in a completely different way. By releasing songs on social media and music sharing sites like SoundCloud, the rap duo was able to draw an enormous group to the VFW, despite never having performed in public before. Frailboys was able to gain popularity through their creative lyrics and catchy beats. They performed all three of the songs that they've released online, along with two new ones.\n\nStudents were packed shoulder to shoulder, dancing and singing along throughout each band's set. By the end of FrailBoys set, the entire crowd was just as hyped as when the night began, and everyone yelled along with the rappers as they ended with their signature song, 2 AM.

But I've also been swimming since about 5 and I also was drawn to swim and dive for the swim aspect,\" said Amitay. Her freshman year she competed at metros, and got 4th in regionals and 12th at states, then as a sophomore she dove at metros, got 2nd at regionals and got 11th at states. After competing at states her sophomore year, Amitay was convinced to focus more on diving, \"a couple coaches from outside diving clubs approached me and urged me to pursue diving outside of school. This caused me to focus on diving a lot more because it has become a sport I can potentially do in college,\" said Amitay. She started doing club diving three times a week, and learned all the technique behind diving, \"My junior year I came in a completely different diver than my sophomore and freshman year. This winter I've spent a lot of time on the boards, ending practices on Mondays and Wednesday's at 9:00 and being on the same board Tuesday and Thursday mornings only 8 hours later,\" said Amitay. All her hard work paid off this year when she went to metros, got 2nd at regionals and 8th at states. \"She's progressed so much, she went to states and metros last year but didn't place or make first cuts. This year she's done really well and will definitely continue to be a threat to other teams,\" said Amitay's captain, Marianne Benyamin. \n<sco:embed type=\"image\" id=21018/>\n<b>Madison Waechter</b>\nSenior captain Madison Waechter had a successful last year on the swim team, \"I really enjoyed my senior year of Blair swim and dive. I'm happy with how my individual events went, and the results of the girls team. We worked really hard all season long to get 3rd at states,\" said Waechter. She has also committed to swim at Wisconsin next year. \"I'm really excited for next year. I know the training will be different and much harder, but I'm excited for the challenge and to compete on the college level,\" said Waechter.\n\n<b>Max Casey-Bolanos</b>\nFreshman Max Casey-Bolanos' first year on Blair swim was a great experience, \"It was really fun, I was able to interact with a lot of new people that I wouldn't normally interact with, and the coaches and the captains made it fun by trying to have lots of team building activities. It was cool being a freshman because I was able to learn stuff from upperclassmen. I enjoyed coming to meets and practices and getting to be with new and old friends,\" said Casey-Bolanos. His best events this season were the 100 backstroke and the 500 freestyle with blistering times of 53.85 and 4:51.96. \"He's a freshman and he scored the most points for the boys team, and he really came out strong this year,\" said Adbaru.

If students were unsure, they could use their high school time to figure it out so that when they went to college they would already have a better idea of what they wanted to do. \n\nRight now at Blair there are specific required classes that all students must pass to graduate. All students must have three social studies credits and they must be U.S History, US Government and Modern World History. English also has a four-year requirement and for science there are at least three classes mandatory for graduation. Students are also required to take High School Assessments (HSAs) and Partnership for Assessment of Readiness for College and Careers (PARCC) tests.\n\nWith a liberal arts curriculum no specific class would be required, just a class that fits each of the subject requirement. Following the liberal arts style, the rest of a student's classes could be chosen by the student depending on what he or she wanted to study. There would be a requirement for math, science, English and social studies but students could choose what kind of class they wanted take under those categories. Instead of government, students could take a political science class.\n\nThis curriculum could benefit students who are not continuing their academic career after high school. For people who aren't going to college, their last four years are important and if they can use those years to learn a trade or area of study, they could excel in the workforce without the traditional college degree. \n\nIf high schools adopted a more liberal arts college approach to teaching students would be able to focus on what they wanted to , they'd be able to suggest courses they found interesting, this could increase attendance levels and attention levels in classrooms. Many kids skip school or fail classes, not because they can't do the work but because they're not interested or inspired. By giving them control of their education, letting them choose, they could be inspired. \n\nFor some students all this freedom would be quite a culture shock coming straight out of middle school. Most students would not be used to making their own choices about what they study, but with the help of counselors and parents, students could follow their passions. Some parents would be concerned about the curriculum. The one that students have now has been made by experts who know what students need to know before leaving school and without it students would not learn the basic things they need to know. The new curriculum would still have core values  they would just be less confining so that students could discover what they like for themselves. \n\nHigh school, instead of restricting students to a set curriculum, should give students the opportunity to explore while their education is free.  They can discover their interests before they get to college, they can develop skills for adulthood and they can have the responsibility to choose - and go to the bathroom without permission being required. \n\nThis idea has never been tried. No one has ever brought higher education to public school but education is about trying new things when old ones don't work. With this new education system educators could change the way students learn into a more creative and diverse community. If adults take the first step and show students that there is more than one way to learn then the students can take the next step and pursue whatever they're impassioned to learn.", "section": 4, "cover": null, "authors": [906], "tags": []}}, {"model": "core.story", "pk": 13522, "fields": {"created": "2017-03-23T16:11:00Z", "modified": "2017-12-19T15:35:37.135Z", "title": "Students participate in town hall", "description": "Rep.

The event held an anti-Trump stance, emphasized by Raskin's introduction of a new chant, \"Stop Trump, stop Pence, impeach them for emoluments,\" which people then repeated intermittently.\n<sco:embed type=\"image\" id=21031/>\nIn addition to Raskin, Van Hollen and Cardin, U.S. Reps. Anthony Brown, John Sarbanes and John Delaney spoke, as well as Montgomery County Councilmembers, Maryland Senators and Maryland Delegates. The only non-elected official to speak, besides those asking questions, was Executive Director of <a href=\" http://wearecasa.org/\">CASA de Maryland</a> Gustavo Torres, who told his story as an immigrant and spoke about those living in fear of deportation under Trump. He ended his speech with the chant \"Maryland sanctuary state.\"\n\nLocal group <a href=\"http://tpmobilization.org/\">Takoma Park Mobilization</a> organized the event to provide an opportunity for constituents to communicate with their representatives and encourage them to resist President Trump, according to lead organizer Jen Wofford. \"We felt that they need to hear from us and know that we want them to fight hard and have a hard line of non-cooperation and they need our energy to keep on fighting and people really wanted to ask questions and engage,\" Wofford said.  The event was one of <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2017/02/21/us/politics/town-hall-protests-obamacare.html\">many town halls</a> being called for across the country. Attendees chanted, \"Our reps show up,\" a contrast with many members of Congress who have been shying away from meeting their constituents.\n\nSocial studies teacher Kevin Moose publicized the event to his students in advance, urging them to attend. He helped students get tickets through local activist, children's author and documentary film maker <a href=\" http://www.lynnecherry.com/\">Lynne Cherry</a>. She reached out to Moose. Cherry \"knew there would be speeches and then the question and answer format and so she wanted to have youth voices represented,\" Moose said. \n<sco:embed type=\"image\" id=21032/>\nBlair student Suad Mohamud, a senior, learned about the event from Moose. She wanted the opportunity to speak with her representatives about issues that concerned her. \"Mr. Moose was asking around to see if there was anyone who wanted to bring up questions for the congressmen and senators so I was excited to do that,\" Mohamud said.\n\nSophomore Camden Roberts also attended the event, independent of Moose. She has been involved in other protests, particularly of Trump's immigration ban and wanted to know more about her elected officials' positions. \"I didn't know as much as I should have about how our elected officials stood and it's important to me that I now know that they believe in protecting our people from our president,\" she said. One topic which particularly resonated with her  was the officials' positions on U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) raids and immigration: they emphasized immigrants' rights and promised efforts to fight against Trump's ban and increase in deportations. \n\nFor elected officials, the forum served as a motivator, and reinforced their understanding of their constituents' support. \"It continues to inspire me to see so many people engaged in democracy, this is we the people at its best and what it tells me is that this movement is strong and that it is sustained,\" Van Hollen said.\n\n<i>The event was livestreamed, and the full footage can be viewed <a href=\"http://tpmobilization.org/townhall-livestream\">here</a>.</i>", "section": 3, "cover": null, "authors": [874], "tags": []}}, {"model": "core.story", "pk": 13523, "fields": {"created": "2017-03-23T16:18:00Z", "modified": "2017-12-19T15:35:37.160Z", "title": "Technology tries to put an end to stranger danger", "description": "Meeting strangers online is becoming more common", "publishable": true, "published": 0, "views": 0, "lead": "Tinder, Uber and other services that rely on the trust of strangers are changing the way people interact online.

She needed an adventure and someone to adventure with her. So one day she picked up her phone, went to the app store,and downloaded Tinder. She wasn't looking for a boyfriend, she was really just looking for someone to talk to but soon enough, talking lead to snapchatting which lead to texting which lead to meeting in person and then to dating. Lizzie and Patrick dated for three months. \n\nEarly on, <a href=\"https://www.gotinder.com/\">Tinder</a> was <a href=\"http://www.vanityfair.com/culture/2015/08/tinder-hook-up-culture-end-of-dating\">pegged</a> as a \"hook up\" app: an app used to meet people, \"get physical,\" and then never see them again. Tinder was for one night stands. Anonymous interactions via the internet have gained popularity over the past couple years. Swipe right, swipe left, meet new people easily and without leaving the comfort of a living room. But now technology is changing the way people think about strangers. \n<sco:embed type=\"image\" id=21034/>\nTinder, Uber and other services that rely on the trust of strangers are changing the way people interact online. Technology is making it easier and faster to meet, talk to, and work with strangers. But is it safe? One of the first lessons kids are taught is to never trust a stranger. Right now Blazers rely on the trust of strangers to get from place to place and to meet new people.\n\nSophomore Elena Davis-Mercer uses Uber as a convenient way for her and her friends to get around. All you gotta do is open up your phone, set a pickup and dropoff location,and press \"find\".\"I've never had a problem with Uber,\" she says. Davis-Mercer does admit that if she ever heard about an incident that happened through Uber, she'd stop using it. \"The convenience isn't worth it, I have other ways to get around if I heard Uber was unsafe,\" she explains.  \n\nUber works only if the consumer is willing to put their trust in a complete stranger. The difference between Uber and a regular taxi service is that instead of the drivers being trained company workers, anyone can sign up to be an Uber driver and make some extra money. Although there are some security precautions in place like a background check before being cleared to drive, calling an Uber means trusting a stranger. Uber has become a worldwide phenomenon, driving around <a href=\"\nhttps://www.forbes.com/sites/ellenhuet/2014/12/17/uber-says-its-doing-1-million-rides-per-day-140-million-in-last-year/#5f1a694252cd\">one million</a> people per day.\n<sco:embed type=\"image\" id=21033/>\nThere are many people, however, who do not feel comfortable with the arbitrary nature of Uber.  Junior Noah Singer, for example, chooses to not use the service. \"I feel like there's no guarantee that they would necessarily be reliable, the people who were driving, that they wouldn't do something bad,\" he says. He thinks that people blindly trust strangers too much online. \"Technology makes it very easy to create a bond with strangers, but it's not a real bond because they're on a computer,\" Singer explains.\n\n Even Lizzie admits that the first time she met her Tinder date in real life she was nervous and even a little scared. \"I had two friends with me just in case something happened,\" she says. Nonetheless, Lizzie still uses Tinder and has had other successful relationships with people she met via the app.\n\nIn a <a href=\"https://www.ted.com/talks/rachel_botsman_we_ve_stopped_trusting_institutions_and_started_trusting_strangers\">TED Talk</a>, Harvard professor Rachel Botsman talks about the newfound trust this generation has in strangers. She says that people used to be able to talk to one another only if they were geographically close. As technology advances and location ceases to be an issue people have become more open and more trusting in strangers. Botsman thinks that this new sense of trust can be a good thing. \"We can embrace the opportunities to redesign systems that are more transparent, inclusive and accountable,\" she explains. \n\nJunior Marc Monteil watched the TED Talk in her AP World History class and found it interesting. \"I've never really thought about that way. I guess we really are trusting strangers a lot more.

She reported that Montano, who she knew as a friend, approached her in the hallway. He asked her for a hug and pressured her for sex, according to police reports. When she refused, Montano forced her into a stall in the boys' restroom. Montano began undressing her while she resisted, when Milian joined Montano in the restroom. They both proceeded to pull down the victim's pants and took turns forcing her to give them oral sex while the other raped her from behind. According to the police report, the victim continuously told them to stop as they were forcing themselves onto her. \n\nThe boys stopped when they heard the bathroom door open.

Here are a few Blazer-created planet names. \n\nThe seven <a href=\"http://www.telegraph.co.uk/science/2017/03/01/oldest-fossil-ever-found-earth-shows-alien-life-mars-likely/\">Earth-sized planets</a> are clustered around a single star.

If the planets orbited a larger star, they would be fried to a crisp. However, all seven bodies are bathed in just the right amount of warmth to hold liquid water. Three of them receive the same amount of heat as Earth, Venus and Mars, putting them in \"the habitable zone.\" The possibility of these planets being hospitable to people or other life forms is an intriguing proposition for NASA technicians to investigate, and also for Blazers to think about.\n<sco:embed type=\"image\" id=21037/>\n Junior Deanna Williams took a more inspirational path and decided to name one of the planets \"Rosa,\" after the late American civil rights activist, Rosa Parks. The meaning behind the name explains itself. Rosa Parks is often mentioned in classrooms when learning about U.S. history. Williams hoped to recognize the effect Rosa Parks had on the Civil Rights Movement with the name. \"Seems to define strength and a new sense of power. Changing times and all. She was a part of an era of change and so are these new planets,\" Williams explains. \n\nNext up is a more straightforward name by senior Leslie Hernandez. She based her name on the liking of the word and the popular zodiac sign, Aquarius. Though there isn't much meaning to the name itself, she wants the planet to have the same characteristics of Earth, but with a twist: no rules. It would be her own world but still resemble her home here on Earth. \"Everything there is here but with no rules or anything,\" Hernandez says, chuckling. \n<sco:embed type=\"image\" id=21038/>\nLastly is a name solely based on the popular video game, Skyrim. Junior Luis Zelaya based his planet name, Nirn, on his beloved Elder Scrolls game.  However, most may not know that there is a relevant meaning for the name. \"Nirn stands for 'mortal planet,' which means living organisms. We don't know if there's life on the new planets yet, but if there is evidence of life, I would call it Nirn,\" Zelaya says. \n\nSadly, NASA will not be collecting names from the public but rather rely on the IAU's (International Astronomical Union) process for naming the planets. Let's just hope the new names aren't lifeless.

At the meeting, the club held a bake sale to raise money for the campaign. \n\nIn the past year, Blazers have successfully raised hundreds of dollars, through fundraisers inspired by the cause, such as selling Girl Hero grams and homemade bracelets. Emma Markus, one of Girl Up's cabinet members, contacted Lenhart and Ferrill and invited them to speak at one of their meetings. \n\nJunior Suraya Mohamud, one of Girl Up's co-presidents, felt that it was important to teach students about the organization's history and expand their knowledge on current events taking place around the world.

However, when students participate in school or club sports, they are getting the exercise that Physical Education (PE) classes provide, and should be exempt.\n\nThe importance of a required gym course in high school is to start healthy exercise habits and encourage students to stay in shape. For students who aren't involved in sports, this is a course that provides them with a way to stay active. But for student athletes, this course is redundant because the importance of exercise is already being gleaned from their participation in varsity-level sports. Varsity sports practice up to six times a week for upwards of two to three hours, with seasons ranging from three months to year-round. With each sport comes a unique training and strengthening program that should count towards a student's gym requirement. \n\nWith the extra commitments sports require from students, they should be able to opt out of a PE class and take something to advance their academic careers such as study halls. This would help student athletes stay on top of homework when they are staying late at school for practices or games. \n<sco:embed type=\"image\" id=21042/>\nSome parents and administrators claim that this system would be unfair and grant a special privilege to students who play sports. Junior Madeleine Allou believes exempting athletes from any course shouldn't be allowed. \"I feel that athletes should be able to manage all school classes while still being able to keep up with their sport,\" Allou said. However, if the requirement was changed to a study period for student athletes, they would receive no advantage in being able to take more classes than another student. They wouldn't have any advantages, as both classes would receive grades, and both classes would benefit the students' individual needs of either physical education or study time. \n\nAnother concern is that teachings in PE courses at school could interfere with a student's success in their sport. Getting injured in gym class can affect an athlete's performance. For example, getting a concussion while in gym could ruin an athlete's chances of playing all season. The U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission conducted a survey of  emergency room reports of P.E.-related injuries in children, and found that in 2007 there were roughly 60,000 reports. Additionally, exercise regimens or techniques taught in class could conflict with those of coaches.\n<sco:embed type=\"image\" id=21043/>\nAt no disadvantage to students who don't participate in sports, athletes should be exempt from the PE requirement in high school, as they already get enough exercise from sports. The importance of lifelong healthy habits is being instilled outside of school; therefore, there is no need for students to supplement this with an average of three hours of gym class per week.

The story is beautifully done and adds another dimension to a timeless classic.\n\nThe story remains the same, Belle and her father live in a small town in France where Belle feels out of place because of her bookish ways. However, the story went deeper than the animated film when it addressed the death of Belle's mother back in Paris. The story begins as Belle's father, Maurice (Kevin Kline), gets lost in the woods on his way back to the town and ends up imprisoned in a beast's castle for picking a rose from his garden. Upon learning of her father's imprisonment, Belle takes his place as prisoner, and to her surprise, starts to see the man behind the beast. \n\n<sco:moviebox id=280>\n\nThis movie mixes magic, love, action, music and humor with the classic story of a princess finding her prince. You get comedic relief from Gaston (Luke Evans) and his sidekick LeFou (Josh Gad), as Gaston tries to win Belle's hand in marriage, and from Cogsworth (Ian McKellen) and Lumiere's (Ewan McGregor) witty back and forth which keeps the mood light in the castle. There's also plenty of action for a princess movie, with Belle racing around on a horse, the townspeople being attacked by magical household objects, and the fight between Gaston and the beast. \n\nThe soundtrack is beautiful and includes favorites such as \"Be Our Guest\" and \"Something There\" as well as new songs like \"How Does A Moment Last Forever\" sang by Celine Dion. The wardrobe, Madame Garderobe is played by Audra McDonald who has a powerful voice, and sings \"Beauty and the Beast\" at the end of the movie. Emma Watson sounds good throughout the movie, and has a clear, pretty voice that compliments every song. \n\nThe cinematography was smooth and shows scenes from all sides and perspectives. When Maurice first enters the castle you see him from the beast's point of view from upstairs and on top of the rose bush. There are also many wide shots contrasting Belle against her surroundings, for example you see Belle from the top of the castle as she rides off in her bright yellow dress to rescue her father. She discovers the impressive library, and they have a dance in the bright ballroom which makes the castle seem more alive than when she first arrived. At first the castle seems dark and empty, with cool tones, it warms up as Belle and the beast get to know each other.\n\nThe special effects were seamless and intricate throughout. This was an important in a movie where the candelabra, piano, and wardrobe are talking, singing, fighting and moving around the castle. The CGI of the beast was realistic and detailed, as was the CGI of the castle characters.\n\nThe movie has created a bit of controversy because of and end scene where you see LeFou dancing happily with a townsmen, which has caused some controversy. Some believe having a gay character in a disney movie is inappropriate and not suitable for children. However this is a film depicting a girl falling in love with a beast, which, unlike homosexuality, should be frowned upon in society.\n\nOverall \"Beauty and the Beast\" is a beautifully crafted film that all audiences can enjoy. The music, cinematography, animation, and acting are all exceptional and add to the heart warming story.", "section": 45, "cover": null, "authors": [900], "tags": []}}, {"model": "core.story", "pk": 13530, "fields": {"created": "2017-03-30T17:01:00Z", "modified": "2017-12-19T15:35:37.391Z", "title": "<i>Life</i> scares the life out of viewers", "description": "The sci-fi horror flick will leave you shaking", "publishable": true, "published": 0, "views": 0, "lead": "<i>Life</i> utilizes strong acting and exceptional cinematography to create a movie that leaves little to no break from action and viewers chattering their teeth.", "text": "Although <i>Life</i> may at first seem to be borrowing the worn-out \"escape from space\" concept, it makes a unique addition to the sci-fi genre; the element of horror. <i>Life</i> utilizes strong acting and exceptional cinematography to create a movie that leaves little to no break from action and viewers chattering their teeth.\n\nThe film begins as six crew members aboard the International Space Station celebrate receiving a space probe from Mars containing a soil sample. They are ecstatic to find that the sample contains a single-celled organism, the first evidence of life beyond Earth. Scientist Hugh Derry (Ariyon Bakare) stimulates the cell to grow and divide, and attempts to provoke the hibernating organism, named \"Calvin\", to wake up with a small electric shock. However, this causes Calvin to become hostile, and it escapes from the chamber it had been contained in and begins to attempt to eat the crew members one by one.\n\nThe moment that Calvin escapes from its holding chamber there is a sharp, sudden shift in tone. From that point on in the movie, viewers are captivated and unable to leave their seats as the threat of an attack from Calvin is always present. The gruesome, gory attacks leave viewers cringing and turning away from the screen while begging to know what happens next. Unlike many horror movies, <i>Life</i> wastes no time in getting to the action, there is little time is spent in exposition before Calvin becomes a hostile adversary.\n\n<sco:moviebox id=281>\n\nThe emotional connections developed with the characters before the shift in tone snap without warning during the movie, adding to the tense drama. Strong acting by the six leads, including Hiroyuki Sanada who plays Japanese crew member Sho Kendo, and Rebecca Furgeson who plays Dr. Miranda North, aids in making viewers emotionally invested. No member of the diverse cast, which includes actors from four different countries, is lagging behind in their performance.\n\nAs with many movies set in outer space, cinematography is a strength of <i>Life</i>. The zero gravity environment aboard the International Space Station is perfectly captured, while Calvin is animated to be as intimidating a creature as possible, both in its appearance and style of consuming its prey. The intricate detail in which every aspect of the space station is depicted is also quite impressive.\n\nA common criticism of <i>Life</i>is that it is too similar to the 1979 thriller <i>Alien</i>. Both movies involve astronauts being trapped aboard space ship with a hostile alien creature, as the astronauts desperately fight to return home alive. However, one can still enjoy <i>Life</i> despite its similarity to the classic 70s film.\n\n<i>Life</i> is an engaging thriller that is not for the faint of heart. Anyone looking for casual movie to see with friends should look elsewhere, but this film is perfect for someone seeking a rush of excitement. And last but not least, <i>Life</i> has a jarring ending that is not to be missed.\n\n<i>Life is rated R for language throughout, some sci-fi violence and terror. It is showing throughout local theaters including Regal Majestic and AMC Wheaton Mall.</i>", "section": 10, "cover": null, "authors": [899], "tags": []}}, {"model": "core.story", "pk": 13531, "fields": {"created": "2017-04-02T17:02:00Z", "modified": "2017-12-19T15:35:37.416Z", "title": "2017 MLB Preview", "description": "(no description)", "publishable": true, "published": 0, "views": 0, "lead": "Spring training and the month of March are an exciting time for baseball fans, but as the spring drags on, fans want to see some real action.

The season begins Apr. 2 with an exciting slate of games including the World Series champion Chicago Cubs and the ever-popular New York Yankees, with the first pitch of the MLB season being thrown by young Tampa Bays Rays star Chris Archer. As for local teams the Nationals are hoping to not lose another first round playoff series, while the Orioles will look to stay afloat in the AL East with the always improving Boston Red Sox. In the AL the Chris Sale-led Red Sox are my favorite to win the pennant over the Indians and their pitching depth, while in the NL if the Nats do not beat themselves they will be able to get past the big bats in Chicago and ride it all the way to a November victory.\n\nPlayoff Predictions \nAL Wild Card: Astros over Orioles\nNL Wild Card: Cardinals over Giants\nAL Division Series: Red Sox over Astros, Indians over Rangers\nNL Division Series: Cubs over Cardinals, Nationals over Dodgers\nALCS: Red Sox over Indians\nNLCS: Nationals over Cubs\nWorld Series: Nationals over Red Sox\n\nAL East\n1. Boston Red Sox\nThe Sox hit it big this offseason after winning the East last season, making the move of the year for starter Chris Sale. Although Drew Pomeranz will have to prove that he can pitch well for more than half a season, Sale and Cy Young winner Rick Porcello will pair nicely atop the rotation. Losing David Ortiz hurts but with Andrew Benintendi, Mookie Betts and Jackie Bradley Jr. roaming the outfield, the Red Sox will be hard to beat.\n<sco:embed type=\"image\" id=21050/>\n2. Baltimore Orioles\nThe Orioles bring back roughly the same team as last year, led by power hitters like Mark Trumbo and Chris Davis and a strong bullpen led by closer Zach Britton and Brad Brach. The rotation is again shaky, but if young arms Dylan Bundy and Kevin Gausman can step up the O's should be in good shape. Third baseman Manny Machado and shortstop J.J. Hardy will have to stay healthy to have a shot in this strong division.\n3. New York Yankees\nA strange look for the Yankees this season: A team filled with youth. Catcher Gary Sanchez and first baseman Greg Bird impressed last season, and the signing of Matt Holliday and Chris Carter add depth in the outfield. The Yankees bullpen is much stronger than their rotation this season. However, the loss of shortstop Didi Gregorius for the start of the season hurts a lot. Expect the Yankees to compete for the top spot in the East.\n4. Toronto Blue Jays\nThe Blue Jays lost a big bat in Edwin Encarnacion but still have two of the best power hitters in the league with third baseman Josh Donaldson and right fielder Jose Bautista in the middle of their lineup. Their rotation is headlined by Team USA star Marcus Stroman and 2016 ERA leader Marco Estrada. This aging team might have some trouble keeping up with the Red Sox.\n5. Tampa Bay Rays\nTampa is still a rebuilding team who did not add much this offseason. They do have great young pitchers in Chris Archer and Jake Odorizzi, but their bats are weak and unproven yet again. Expect another last place finish for Evan Longoria and the Rays, who will get a midseason boost when former National Wilson Ramos returns from knee injury.\n\nAL Central\n1. Cleveland Indians\nThe AL champs lost virtually no one save strikeout prone Mike Napoli and added power bat Edwin Encarnacion and will return Michael Brantley from injury. They have rotation that runs six or seven deep led by Corey Kluber and Carlos Carrasco, and even with Jason Kipnis and Lonnie Chisenhall out to start the season, the Indians will be the favorites in the Central.\n2. Detroit Tigers\nThe Tigers' bats are strong, with Miguel Cabrera, Victor Martinez and Ian Kinsler leading the way, paired with a powerful rotation of Justin Verlander, Jordan Zimmermann and Rookie of the Year Michael Fulmer. Young outfielders JaCoby Jones and Tyler Collins will have to step up if Detroit wants to make the playoffs.\n<sco:embed type=\"image\" id=21051/>\n3. Kansas City Royals\nKC finished third in the Central last season, but adding Brandon Moss and Jorge Soler boosts their offensive production. However, the loss of Wade Davis in the bullpen really hurts an already weak pitching staff. Their rotation of journeymen veterans behind Danny Duffy will have to produce.\n4. Chicago White Sox\nOther than Todd Frazier and Jose Abreu, the White Sox do not have much offense after trading for prospects this offseason. They still have a deep staff after getting James Shields, Miguel Gonzalez and Derek Holland this winter. Do not expect much offensively from this team.\n5. Minnesota Twins\nThe Twins were miserable last year and seem to be banking on the development of prospects Byron Buxton, Max Kepler and Jorge Polanco because their only major acquisition was lefty Hector Santiago. Expect great production from infielders Miguel Sano, Brian Dozier and Joe Mauer, but do not expect the Twins to finish anywhere but well below .500.\n\n\nAL West\n1. Texas Rangers\nThe reigning two-time AL West winners bring back a similar team with loads of young talent led by veterans Adrian Beltre and Jonathan Lucroy. Their strong staff with Cole Hamels and Yu Darvish will allow young bats like Nomar Mazara and Rougned Odor to become solid everyday players. Expect these guys to lock up a division championship and a playoff berth.\n2. Houston Astros\nHouston may have the best lineup top to bottom in the majors, with perennial MVP candidate Jose Altuve at the top, a great outfield led by George Springer and young stars Alex Bregman and Carlos Correa on the left side of the infield. Their pitching is where they fall short, with only Lance McCullers and Dallas Keuchel as trustworthy arms. They also have a strong bullpen, but can they keep up with the Rangers?\n3. Los Angeles Angels\nLA, where Nationals go to die. Danny Espinosa, Yunel Escobar and Ben Revere will be competing to start alongside Mike Trout, the best player in the game according to players and analysts alike. However, even Trout and legend Albert Pujols cannot bring the Angels into the playoffs, though pitchers Garrett Richards and Matt Shoemaker should bounce back from injuries this season.\n4. Seattle Mariners\nThe M's have strong starting pitched led by Felix Hernandez and Hisashi Iwakuma, and huge bats Nelson Cruz, Robinson Cano and Kyle Seager in the middle of the lineup, but after that the Mariners will be lucky to finish third in this division.\n5. Oakland Athletics\nThe A's are in trouble. They do not have the pieces of a rebuilding franchise, but do not have the pieces of a franchise that is looking to win. Their best pitcher, Sonny Gray and Kendall Graveman will have to carry this lowly team.\n\nNL East\n1. Washington Nationals\nThe Nats are looking to get to the second round of the playoffs for the first time ever, but Bryce Harper will have to have a bounceback year for that to happen. The pitching of Max Scherzer, Stephen Strasburg and Tanner Roark will keep them steady all year, and star shortstop Trea Turner will use his speed to produce like he did last season. Not to mention they picked up catcher Matt Wieters. If the Nats can stay healthy, they should breeze through the regular season.\n2. New York Mets\nThe Mets return quite literally the exact same team as last season minus closer Jeurys Familia, who is suspended 15 games. Plagued by injury the last two seasons, the Mets will need all seven or eight of their starters for this season. They will also need captain David Wright and outfielders Jay Bruce and Yoenis Cespedes to have big seasons in Queens.\n3. Miami Marlins\nThe Marlins may have the best outfield in the major leagues led by Giancarlo Stanton and Christian Yelich, but their pitching is far from perfect, with an aging Edinson Volquez at the top of the rotation. If infielders Dee Gordon and Adeiny Hechavarria can hit, the Marlins should put some pressure on the Mets and Nats.\n4. Atlanta Braves\nAdding Brandon Phillips, R.A. Dickey and Matt Kemp in the last year makes the Braves older and wiser, because rookie shortstop Dansby Swanson is rearing to go for the Braves, whose pitching staff led by Julio Teheran will be average at best. Expect the Braves to finish no higher than third in this division.\n5. Philadelphia Phillies\nThe Phillies were so desperate for pitching they paid Jeremy Hellickson a max contract, but they also got Clay Buchholz. The Phillies are definitely still rebuilding and will not have many wins this season, but they do have solid young players to build around.\n\nNL Central\n1. Chicago Cubs\nThe reigning champions lost Dexter Fowler and closer Aroldis Chapman, then went and traded for Wade Davis. Not a bad tradeoff. We already know about Kris Bryant, Ben Zobrist and Anthony Rizzo, but this season Kyle Schwarber will be there the whole year. The rotation led by Jake Arrieta and Jon Lester proved effective enough for the hitters to power the Cubs last season, so expect more of the same this year.\n<sco:embed type=\"image\" id=21052/>\n2. St. Louis Cardinals\nHaven't heard this one before, but the Cardinals are very good. They replaced Matt Holliday with World Series hero Dexter Fowler and moved Randal Grichuk over to left field. Yadier Molina is still a top three catcher, but the rotation took a hit with Tyler Lyons, Zach Duke and Alex Reyes all out for the season. Kolten Wong and the Cardinals will still compete with the Cubs for the top spot.\n3. Pittsburgh Pirates\nAnother team with depth everywhere, the Pirates might be the odd team out in the NL. Star Andrew McCutchen's strong second half proved he's back, while Josh Harrison and Starling Marte are ready to prove they are perennial All-Stars. The young pitching staff needs to prove themselves, but overall the Pirates are not to be messed with.\n4. Milwaukee Brewers\nThe Brewers and Reds counter the strength of the top three in this division. They still have Ryan Braun, but other than Orlando Arcia at shortstop, the Crew are not going to have much success this year. Starting pitchers Javy Guerra and Wily Peralta cannot carry this team.\n5. Cincinnati Reds\nAfter losing Brandon Phillips, the Reds have Joey Votto and Billy Hamilton as their only recognizable names in the lineup. Their rotation led by Scott Feldman leaves much to be desired. Do not expect anywhere near a winning record from this team headed in the wrong direction.\n\nNL West\n1. Los Angeles Dodgers\nLA was not close to beating the Cubs in the NLCS, but with Corey Seager developing, anything is possible for these guys. The staff of Clayton Kershaw, Scott Kazmir and Kenta Maeda is excellent and Adrian Gonzalez and Justin Turner round out a terrific infield for the boys in blue. Expect more Yasiel Puig drama to mask how good the Dodgers really are.\n2. San Francisco Giants\nThe Giants have the best catcher in the league in Buster Posey, and one of the best pitching staffs led by Madison Bumgarner and Johnny Cueto. The addition of closer Mark Melancon only adds to this team's power. They lack depth in the outfield but do have shortstop Brandon Crawford and first baseman Brandon Belt. They will keep it tight with the Dodgers.\n<sco:embed type=\"image\" id=21049/>\n3. Arizona Diamondbacks\nThe D-Backs are led on offense by Paul Goldschmidt and on the mound by Zack Greinke. They will get back A.J. Pollock from injury and acquired a young arm in Taijuan Walker to top off a strong pitching rotation. If their rotation stays healthy the Diamondbacks can come close to the top two in this division.\n4. Colorado Rockies\nThe Rockies signed Ian Desmond, who promptly broke his hand, and already had defensive stud Gerardo Parra to replace him. These Rockies are deep in the field, but the mound is a different story. Jon Gray will lead a weak rotation in a field where the air is already thin, while a below average bullpen will not help their chances.\n5. San Diego Padres\nThe Padres seem keen on trying their luck with prospects Manny Margot and Hunter Renfroe in the outfield, partially because they have no one else to put there. They might be able to energize a lineup that features Wil Myers, but not much else. The pitching leaves much to be desired because Jhoulys Chacin and Trevor Cahill are not front line starters. Anything above last place would be a happy surprise for the lowly Padres.", "section": 15, "cover": null, "authors": [877], "tags": []}}, {"model": "core.story", "pk": 13532, "fields": {"created": "2017-03-15T00:28:00Z", "modified": "2017-12-19T15:35:37.453Z", "title": "Bumper stickers of Blair", "description": "The careful art of vehicular decoration", "publishable": true, "published": 0, "views": 0, "lead": "For the students who drive themselves to school everyday, the car that they take can be one of two things.

It's the biggest, it really sticks out more than the other ones, and I just really like the color orange. People definitely like to rat on the Ravens and the Orioles. My dad grew up in Baltimore and my grandparents are big sports fans in Baltimore, so we prefer the Baltimore sports teams over the Washington sports teams and we're not afraid to show it.\"\n\n\"I like having them on there. I think a car without bumper stickers is kind of stupid, because it spices the road up, you're like, 'oh, that's cool,' looking across the lanes and seeing cool stuff. It's kind of like, who you are. A lot of my bumper stickers are kind of specific to a person. They just kind of show my family and my beliefs. Like the Takoma Park sticker, which for me represents the greatest city in America.\"\n\n<b>Nate Blower:</b> the reluctant bumper\n\nNate Blower is a senior at Blair who's not a big fan of bumper stickers. Okay, maybe small tasteful ones. Maybe.\n<sco:embed type=\"image\" id=21069/>\n\"You should ask my parents about why I have bumper stickers. I didn't put them on. They did it to express themselves, I guess. I mean, I'm a fan of like one or two bumper stickers. I like the Obama ones, but the other ones I don't really like that much. Except the one that says 'Ski the East.' I'm a big fan of skiing.\n\nWhen I get my own car, I'd probably put up like one or two bumper stickers. If I go to a college maybe I'll use a bumper sticker to let me park on campus. Or, like, sometimes to go to a dump and dump off trash you need a special bumper sticker on your car. So I'd use that one.\n\nAs far as expression goes, your bumper isn't really important, but it is a place, I guess. I might put up a bumper sticker, but it would have to be a tasteful one, not a very big one, not a very in your face one. Just a nice small bumper sticker. It's distracting when they're big and in your face. I don't understand why you have to do that. Some people cover their entire cars with weird sayings. I don't like that.\"\n\n<b>Connor Clark:</b> the Obama Mama\n\nConnor Clark is a senior at Blair who wants people to know about him and his opinions after just one glance at his bumper.\n<sco:embed type=\"image\" id=21070/>\n\"I've got a couple stickers from my moms business. She works for First Book, a nonprofit in D.C. that's working towards lowering the education gap between low and high income families. I've got several anti-Trump bumper stickers. They're wonderful, mostly 'cause, f*ck trump, right? I also have an 'Obama Mama' sticker. I think that's the crowning glory of my bumper stickers right now. I am truly the Obama Mama.\n\nI started out with bumper stickers because I got my family's old car with a couple already on it, but then I kept on finding more bumper stickers that I wanted on my car, so I kept adding them. I see things and just think, 'Wow, I want this to be something that I share with other people.'\n\nThere's no expectation that people are going to change their beliefs because of a sticker on my car, but you can definitely form an opinion based on bumper stickers. You can look at a person's bumper stickers and those are the things that they want to express about themselves to other people in a public place. Everybody sees that, random people see that.\"\n\nBaltimore sports fan, Obama Mama, or just local dump patron, people can form an opinion or at least an image of a person based on the stickers they have on their bumper.

Here's SCO's NFL mock draft for the upcoming season.\n\n<b>Pick 1: Cleveland Browns</b>\nRyan: Myles Garrett, DE, Texas A&M\nThe Browns have the most holes of any team in the NFL, with few star players other than offensive tackle Joe Thomas. Because of this, they'll opt to take the most talented player in the draft, Myles Garrett.\nCharlie: Myles Garrett, DE, Texas A&M\nGarrett impressed in game, at the combine, and pretty much everywhere else. On a team devoid of game-breaking talent, he will be a welcome addition.\n<sco:embed type=\"image\" id=21072/>\n<b>Pick 2: San Francisco 49ers</b>\nRyan: Jonathan Allen, DT, Alabama\nSimilarly to the Browns, the 49ers have many needs up and down the roster. They will attempt to give their defense a spark by drafting the monstrous tackle Jonathan Allen.\nCharlie: Jonathan Allen, DT, Alabama\nThe 49ers have spent the last two drafts beefing up their offensive line with Arik Armstead and DeForest Buckner, and yet their defense still needs interior help.\n\n<b>Pick 3: Chicago Bears</b>\nRyan: Jamal Adams, S, LSU\nThe Bears have found their running back of the future in Jordan Howard, so they'll upgrade on the defensive end early in the draft this year with shutdown safety Jamal Adams.\nCharlie: Solomon Thomas, DE, Stanford\nPairing young defensive tackle Eddie Goldman with pass rusher Solomon Thomas will finally give the Bears a way to chase down opposition quarterbacks.\n\n<b>Pick 4: Jacksonville Jaguars</b>\nRyan: Leonard Fournette, RB, LSU\nFournette is the clear cut top offensive player in this draft class. Jacksonville would be glad to steal him with the fourth overall pick, as he would provide much needed help to Blake Bortles.\nCharlie: Jamal Adams, S, LSU\nThe Jaguars offense is one quarterback away, so they'll continue to draft defense. The pairing of Jalen Ramsey and Jamal Adams will wear down opposition passing attacks.\n\n<b>Pick 5: Tennessee Titans (from Los Angeles Rams)</b>\nRyan: Marshon Lattimore, CB, Ohio State\nLattimore is an easy choice to upgrade the weak Titans secondary and boost Tennessee into the playoffs.\nCharlie: Marshon Lattimore, CB, Ohio State\nThe Titans only good corner is the second McCourty brother, and solidifying the secondary will go a long way to improving the team's weak defense.\n\n<b>Pick 6: New York Jets</b>\nRyan: Marlon Humphrey, CB, Alabama\nWith Darrelle Revis gone, the Jets desperately need a new star cornerback. Plugging Humphrey into the lineup would be the best possible solution to their secondary woes.\nCharlie: DeShone Kizer, QB, Notre Dame\nThe Jets love taking quarterbacks higher than they should. Unless they make a move on Colin Kaepernick, it looks like another first round passer will come to New York.\n\n<b>Pick 7: Los Angeles Chargers</b>\nRyan: Malik Hooker, S, Ohio State\nYet another team with issues in the defensive backfield, the Chargers will shore up a weakness at safety by taking Malik Hooker.\nCharlie: Malik Hooker, S, Ohio State\nAfter losing Eric Weddle, the Chargers need a good ballhawking safety to shore up the center of the field.\n\n<b>Pick 8: Carolina Panthers</b>\nRyan: Dalvin Cook, RB, Florida State\nThe combination of Cam Newton, Kelvin Benjamin, and Dalvin Cook would be deadly to opposing defenses.\nCharlie: Leonard Fournette, RB, LSU\nJonathan Stewart is too old to carry the bruising back load. Enter Leonard Fournette, ready and willing to tote the rock twenty times a game.\n\n<b>Pick 9: Cincinnati Bengals</b>\nRyan: Solomon Thomas, DE, Stanford\nThe Bengals defensive line will be one to fear if they can pair Solomon Thomas with Geno Atkins.\nCharlie: Jabrill Peppers, S, Michigan\nThe Bengals roster has been heavily depleted during free agency, and a playmaker the caliber of Peppers should ignite things on the back end.\n\n<b>Pick 10: Buffalo Bills</b>\nRyan: Mike Williams, WR, Clemson\nThe Bills clearly need a second wide receiver to complement Sammy Watkins. The two Clemson products should work well together.\nCharlie: Mike Williams, WR, Clemson\nTyrod Taylor is ready to grab hold of the franchise-quarterback role, but he's going to need more than Sammy Watkins to find success.\n\n<b>Pick 11: New Orleans Saints</b>\nRyan: Derek Barnett, DE, Tennessee\nThe Saints' offense is stellar, but they need an impact player like Barnett to improve their struggling defense.\nCharlie: Derek Barnett, DE, Tennessee\nBarnett is instant pass rush, and across from Cameron Jordan he should get ample opportunities to get to the quarterback.\n<sco:embed type=\"image\" id=21073/>\n<b>Pick 12: Cleveland Browns (from Philadelphia Eagles)</b>\nRyan: Mitchell Trubisky, QB, North Carolina\nThis might be a reach, and a risky pick, but the Browns cannot after another year with a dud at the quarterback position.\nCharlie: Marlon Humphrey, CB, Alabama\nCleveland's first pick bolstered the pass rush, and the second will focus on the aging secondary. Humphrey would likely push Joe Haden onto the trade block.\n\n<b>Pick 13: Arizona Cardinals</b>\nRyan: DeShone Kizer, QB, Notre Dame\nKizer is an accurate, athletic option to replace the aging Carson Palmer.\nCharlie: O.J. Howard, TE, Alabama\nJermaine Gresham is not the answer at tight end for the Cardinals. After losing Michael Floyd, and looking ahead to Larry Fitzgerald's retirement, this offense needs an influx of young weapons.\n\n<b>Pick 14: Philadelphia Eagles (from Minnesota Vikings)</b>\nRyan: Christian McCaffrey, RB/WR, Stanford\nThe versatile, dynamic McCaffrey can single-handedly take over games for the Eagles.\nCharlie: Dalvin Cook, RB, Florida State\nDarren Sproles and Wendell Smallwood can't carry the load in Philly. Cook will take some of the pressure off of Carson Wentz's arm.\n\n<b>Pick 15: Indianapolis Colts</b>\nRyan: Cam Robinson, OT, Alabama\nAndrew Luck can't carry the Colts himself. He still might have to, but at least Cam Robinson might help keep him healthy.\nCharlie: Forrest Lamp, OG, Western Kentucky\nThe Indianapolis Colts have spent several picks on o-line help, but Andrew Luck is still getting hurt. Lamp will be a welcome addition to the offensive trench.\n\n<b>Pick 16: Baltimore Ravens</b>\nRyan: Taco Charlton, DE, Michigan\nCharlton is a massive pass rusher with the potential to become Baltimore's next great defender.\nCharlie: John Ross, WR, Washington\nThe Ravens need fewer \"good soldier\" types and more sexy playmakers. The 40-yard dash record holder fits the bill.\n\n<b>Pick 17: Washington Redskins</b>\nRyan: Reuben Foster, LB, Alabama\nAdding Foster will improve the Redskins' poor run defense. Despite questions surrounding Foster's character, he is the right choice here.\nCharlie: Takkarist McKinley, OLB, UCLA\nTak McKinley not only has an awesome name, but will also be a nice pair with outside linebacker Ryan Kerrigan. If Junior Gallette finally gets healthy, the 'Skins defense will be looking nice.\n\n<b>Pick 18: Tennessee Titans</b>\nRyan: John Ross, WR, Washington\nThe Titans have lacked an explosive offense for years, but the combination of Mariota and Ross will create one of the speediest offensive attacks in the league.\nCharlie: Corey Davis, WR, Western Michigan\nCorey Davis will move to number one on the wide receiver depth chart, ahead of Rishard Matthews, Tajae Sharpe and the perennially underutilized Kendall Wright.\n\n<b>Pick 19: Tampa Bay Buccaneers</b>\nRyan: Jabrill Peppers, S, Michigan\nThe Buccaneers will roll the dice on the ultra-athletic Peppers, who can bolster both their special teams and secondary.\nCharlie: Christian McCaffrey, RB/WR, Stanford\nMcCaffrey can be a jack-of-all-trades for quarterback Cam Newton, helping out in the passing, rushing, and return game.\n\n<b>Pick 20: Denver Broncos</b>\nRyan: Zach Cunningham, LB, Vanderbilt\nComing from a smaller SEC school like Vanderbilt, Cunningham is one of the most underrated players in this draft class. The Broncos will steal this dynamic player with the twentieth pick.\nCharlie: Reuben Foster, LB, Alabama\nWith the retirement of DeMarcus Ware and the loss of Danny Trevathan last year, the Broncos' linebacker corps is looking a little sparse.\n\n<b>Pick 21: Detroit Lions</b>\nRyan: Takkarist McKinley, OLB, UCLA\nMcKinley is a versatile player that can fill multiple roster holes in the Lions' defense.\nCharlie: Caleb Brantley, DT, Florida\nHaloti Ngata won't last forever, and Caleb Brantley will force teams to stop doubling Ezekiel Ansah. Tyrunn Walker is also not the long-term answer.\n\n<b>Pick 22: Miami Dolphins</b>\nRyan: Ryan Ramczyk, OT, Wisconsin\nThe Dolphins will draft bruising offensive lineman Ryan Ramczyk to create running room for Jay Ajayi.\nCharlie: David Njoku, TE, Miami\nNjoku stays in Miami, and learns the ropes from free-agent acquisition Julius Thomas in Adam Gase's tight end-heavy offense.\n\n<b>Pick 23: New York Giants</b>\nRyan: Garrett Bolles, OT, Utah\nThe Giants desperately need to replace the massive bust that is Ereck Flowers.\nCharlie: Ryan Ramczyk, OT, Wisconsin\nEreck Flowers is trash. Sorry, Giants fans. Ryan Ramczyk would be a day one starter for Big Blue.\n<sco:embed type=\"image\" id=21074/>\n<b>Pick 24: Oakland Raiders</b>\nRyan: Haason Reddick, LB, Temple\nThe Raiders' defense is strong, but they have a weakness at linebacker. Enter the underrated Haason Reddick from Temple.\nCharlie: Haason Reddick, LB, Temple\nPerry Riley Jr. is more of a stopgap, and Malcolm Smith is gone, leaving a spot open on the Raiders' already stacked defense.\n\n<b>Pick 25: Houston Texans</b>\nRyan: O.J. Howard, TE, Alabama\nWhoever the Texans start at quarterback next year, he'll need some weapons other than DeAndre Hopkins.\nCharlie: Deshaun Watson, QB, Clemson\nIf the Texans don't pick up Tony Romo, they'll go after the most pro-ready quarterback in the draft: Deshaun Watson. This guy just finds ways to win.\n\n<b>Pick 26: Seattle Seahawks</b>\nRyan: Malik McDowell, DT, Michigan State\nThe Seahawks can add to their solid pass rush with the 285 pound beast McDowell.\nCharlie: Gareon Conley, CB, Ohio State\nRichard Sherman might be on his way out, but even if he stays, the Legion of Boom needs another defender on the island.\n\n<b>Pick 27: Kansas City Chiefs</b>\nRyan: Adoree' Jackson, CB, USC \nWith Jackson and Tyreek Hill as return threats, opposing special teams will be scrambling to defend the Chiefs during kickoffs.\nCharlie: Alvin Kamara, RB, Tennessee\nThe Chiefs got rid of franchise rushing leader Jamaal Charles, and while the Spencer Ware/Charcandrick West combo is enticing, an athletic freak like Kamara could always find a place.\n\n<b>Pick 28: Dallas Cowboys</b>\nRyan: David Njoku, TE, Miami\nUnfortunately for Cowboys fans, Jason Witten is on his way out, but luckily David Njoku is a capable replacement.\nCharlie: Tim Williams, OLB, Alabama\nThe Cowboys will take the best defensive player left on the board at pick number 28. Tim Williams would be a day one starter alongside Sean Lee and maybe Jaylon Smith.\n\n<b>Pick 29: Green Bay Packers</b>\nRyan: Charles Harris, DE, Missouri\nHarris is an explosive, versatile defender that can help the Packers not always rely on their powerful offensive attack.\nCharlie: Garrett Bolles, OT, Utah\nThe Packers have been hemorrhaging offensive linemen, and are far more likely to go after replacements in the draft than in free agency.\n\n<b>Pick 30: Pittsburgh Steelers</b>\nRyan: Gareon Conley, CB, Ohio State\nConley could work well as a slot corner in Pittsburgh alongside the aging William Gay.\nCharlie: Budda Baker, S, Washington\nBaker would fit nicely into either the third safety or nickel cornerback spot in the Steelers secondary.\n\n<b>Pick 31: Atlanta Falcons</b>\nRyan: Forrest Lamp, OG, Western Kentucky\nLamp is this year's underrated small school lineman that will break out on the national stage.\nCharlie: Fabian Moreau, CB, UCLA\nFabian Moreau would be a high first round pick in most drafts, but in this year's loaded college secondary, he's a great value pick for the Falcons across from Desmond Trufant.\n<sco:embed type=\"image\" id=21075/>\n<b>Pick 32: New Orleans Saints (from New England Patriots)</b>\nRyan: Patrick Mahomes II, QB, Texas Tech\nMahomes can develop behind Drew Brees as he learns a more traditional NFL offense.\nCharlie: Mitchell Trubisky, QB, North Carolina\nThe New Orleans Saints have two first round picks after trading with the Patriots, and one will definitely go towards defense.

Throughout the game, strong pitching by the Cougars and fielding miscues by the Blazers prevented Blair from making up ground and resulted in a 7-2 Blazer loss.\n\nThe game opened with Blair's Scott Gahart pitching to the Quince Orchard shortstop. An error allowed the runner to advance to first, but Gahart responded with a strikeout. However, the Cougars blasted two consecutive doubles to left field, scoring two runs for Quince Orchard. The Blazers escaped the inning with a double play, but the 2-0 QO lead proved too large to surmount. \nIn the bottom of the first, Ryan Bratton opened for the Blazers with a single. But Bratton was stranded on base as the Quince Orchard pitcher racked up three straight strikeouts. The Blazers began to get back on track in the second when Gahart tossed a scoreless inning and hit an RBI single to score first baseman Johnny Pietanza. \n\nQuince Orchard retook control of the game in the third inning, when their first baseman scored off an RBI double by their designated hitter. When it was the Blazers' turn to bat, second baseman Zach Dunne was tagged out at home trying to advance on a groundout and QO left the inning with a 3-1 advantage. The Cougars extended their lead in the fourth as sloppy fielding by the Blazers allowed them to earn three steals in the inning, including one of home. After two Blazer strikeouts and a groundout, QO left the fourth inning with a four run lead.\n\nQuince Orchard was dominant on the bases in the fourth inning earning seven stolen bases throughout the game. \"They were getting good jumps and I was taking too long to get the ball to first,\" Gahart said. \n\nThe Blair and Quince Orchard pitchers traded zeroes in the fifth inning. However, in the sixth, the Blazer bats finally began to show signs of life. Although the Blazers let up another QO run on a double play, they rebounded as left fielder Henry Wiebe hit a double and scored on an RBI single by shortstop Joey Merrill. \n\nMistakes in the field doomed the Blazers in the top of the seventh. An attempt to pick off the QO runner at first flew past Pietanza and into right field, allowing another Cougar run to score. This left Blair down by five runs going into the last half inning.\n\nAfter two singles, it appeared that the Blazers might have a chance to pull off the improbable comeback. With two outs, Wiebe launched a ball deep into right field. But it was not to be, as the Quince Orchard outfielder brought down the ball to clinch the win for the Cougars. \n\nAlthough Gahart displayed solid command of his offspeed pitches, including his curveball and slider, Quince Orchard batters took advantage of his fastball throughout the game. \"I was throwing my offspeed pitches low in the zone. I was getting strikes, but I may have been throwing too many strikes,\" he said.\n\nAfter an impressive 5-2 start to their season, the Blazers have suffered three straight losses. \"We need a lot more cagework and a lot more tee work,\" assistant coach Bryce Shemer said.\n\n<i>Next matchup: The Blazers look to get back on track as they face the Northwood Gladiators (0-7) at home.</i>", "section": 14, "cover": null, "authors": [899], "tags": []}}, {"model": "core.story", "pk": 13537, "fields": {"created": "2017-04-19T01:16:00Z", "modified": "2017-12-19T15:35:37.628Z", "title": "White + male + upcounty = Our next SMOB", "description": "The Student Member of the Board choices need to be more diverse", "publishable": true, "published": 0, "views": 0, "lead": "Although Montgomery County has an array of students from different backgrounds, the majority of the SMOB candidates all come from the same one.

Unfortunately, for many students it is difficult to relate to either of their options.\n\nAlthough Montgomery County has an array of students from different backgrounds, the majority of the SMOB candidates all come from the same one.  There needs to be more diversity among SMOB candidates to have different and more diverse issues raised and to better represent the county's array of different people.\n<sco:embed type=\"image\" id=21085/>\nThe students of <a href=\"http://www.montgomeryschoolsmd.org/about/statistics.aspx\">Montgomery County</a> come from 164 different countries and are 23.4 percent black, 23.4 percent Hispanic and 15.7 percent Asian, yet this diverse student body is faced with two possibilities for SMOB: a white male from upcounty or another white male from upcounty. Since the creation of the Student Member of the Board nearly 40 years ago this has mostly been the case. \n\nOf the 39 <a href=\"http://www.montgomeryschoolsmd.org/boe/smob/history.aspx\">past SMOBs</a> only 12 of them have come from downcounty or Northeast Consortium (NEC) schools, including two from Blair. Most of the SMOBs come from upcounty schools, which are known to be more affluent, such as Bethesda Chevy-Chase (BCC) and Richard Montgomery.  These schools are vastly different from schools in the Downcounty Consortium such as Kennedy, Einstein and Blair. Compare <a href=\"http://www.montgomeryschoolsmd.org/departments/regulatoryaccountability/glance/currentyear/schools/04406.pdf\">BCC</a>, where current SMOB Eric Guerci attends, and  <a href=\"http://www.montgomeryschoolsmd.org/departments/regulatoryaccountability/glance/currentyear/schools/04815.pdf\">Kennedy High School </a>, whose last (and only) SMOB came in 2000. BCC has a graduation rate of over 95 percent while Kennedy's is slightly less than 80 percent. \n\nThere are also significant financial differences when it comes to location, at BCC the amount of students who have ever been on Free and Reduced Meals (FARMS) is 20.9 percent,<a href=\"http://www.montgomeryschoolsmd.org/departments/regulatoryaccountability/glance/currentyear/schools/04427.pdf\">at Whitman </a>, another upcounty school it is less than 5 percent however in downcounty schools that number is significantly higher, at Kennedy it is 79.2 percent and even at <a href=\"http://www.montgomeryschoolsmd.org/departments/regulatoryaccountability/glance/currentyear/schools/04757.pdf\">Blair</a> it is 55 percent. \n<sco:embed type=\"image\" id=21083/>\nThere's a clear difference in the status of these schools, and 70 percent of the student members of the board coming from upcounty have done little to help the students from the schools that are struggling. While current SMOB nominees are trying to get food trucks to come to schools upcounty, there are many students downcounty who can scarcely afford the school lunches. If more students from downcounty were able to secure a position as SMOB they could bring the issues that they face to the Board of Education's attention instead of these issues being cruised over or being brought up by a person who doesn't experience the issues first hand. Schools in the lower part of the county such as Kennedy and Einstein are facing different issues than schools upcounty such as BCC and their voice deserves to be heard as much as the voices of the upcounty students\n<sco:embed type=\"image\" id=21082/>\nThere is also a lack of young women who make up SMOB members. Only 28 percent of past SMOB members have been female. There are many issues that affect women in school, dress codes and sexual harassment to name a few, and these issues are more likely to come up with a women representative. Women bring another perspective to the table, even when it is not specifically about female dominated issues. Take  <a href=\"https://ananyaforsmob.com/platform/\">Ananya Tadikonda</a> who ran, unsuccessfully, for SMOB for this year, but brought up issues such as diversifying the curriculum, allowing students to follow their passions and allocating money to the minority scholars program, all of which were unique to her in a pool of seven other male candidates. From a different perspective, she was able to bring light to new problems.\n\nWith most of Blair's population, and over half of MCPS's, being minorities and the SMOB continuously being of the upcounty, white, male type, the views of these groups and the issues that these groups face can be overlooked. Without having someone, time after time, who can truly reflect and represent a vast number of MCPS students and the issues they face in school, we the students are essentially left voiceless. Here at Blair we pride ourselves on having diversity and on the different perspectives and experiences it brings to the table.

In the second round the Terps faced off against West Virginia (WVU) and though they started off slow, they beat WVU by 27 points aided by a <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RpUrshCNVKE\"> three quarter court shot </a> by freshman Destiny Slocum. \n\nIn the Sweet 16, the Terps faced off against the 10 seed Oregon who had already upset two teams before. Though Oregon was the underdog they came out strong and rattled Maryland early in the game. They were able to slow the pace of the game down, which stopped Maryland's full court game. The Terps were never able to settle into the game and ended up losing the game 63-77. \n\nThough the Terps fell short and lost their chance to face off against UConn for a second time, they still have plenty to be proud about. They played a strong season and made it to the Sweet 16 a major accomplishment for any team. Brionna Jones and Shatori Walker- Kimbrough were able to end their careers on an amazing season and to cap it off they were names to the first and third AP all American team.

Magruder kept the game close and competitive in the first half, but Blair's offense was relentless in the second half, winning countless faceoffs, dominating possession, and getting shots at every opportunity to win an important game.\n\nBoth teams came out strong to start the game. Blair won the opening faceoff and immediately began to attack the net. After a stop by a Magruder defender, the Colonels went on a speedy counterattack, charging through Blair's middies and scoring the first goal of the game only 47 seconds into the contest.\n\nBlair retaliated the instant the game resumed, with sophomore offensive middie Calvin Bruewlhide winning the faceoff, charging down the field himself, and ripping a shot into the top left corner of the net at 11:03. Just 10 seconds after giving up the first goal, the score was even again. The first quarter was very back and forth with both sides getting good scoring opportunities. Less than a minute after the Blazers tied the game at one, Magruder took a shot from the right side that was denied by senior goalie Michael Cales, but a Colonel forward was able to scoop up the rebound and score less than 10 seconds later.\n\nDetermined to even the game again, Blair put on the pressure for the rest of the opening quarter, passing well in the offensive zone and getting a number of good shots off before senior attacker and attacker Paul Moser was able to sneak one by the Magruder keeper to even the game at two apiece. \n\nTo start the second quarter, Magruder won the faceoff, a feat they would only be able to accomplish a few more times in the contest, thanks to stellar play from Bruewlhide. \"Faceoffs were huge in this game. Calvin [Bruewlhide] played out of his mind. We dominated on faceoffs and every time we got down and were able to possess, kill time, and put a couple goals in too,\"  head coach Spencer Feeny remarked after the game.\n\nBlair was able to win possession back immediately, and attacker Sean Tan received a pass and darted down the field, cutting to the left and beating the goalie near the post to capture the lead only 30 seconds into the second quarter. \n\nMagruder was able to re-tie the game at three exactly two minutes later due to Blair getting into foul trouble. After a huge hit at 10:15 by senior middie and co-captain, Daniel Jones, the referee called a foul and had Jones sent off, giving Magruder a man advantage. Then, almost immediately afterward, senior defender and co-captain Nick Yonkos committed a foul and was also taken off. Magruder scored their goal to tie it on the ensuing possession.\n\nThe game continued to be fast-paced and very back and forth until the very end of the half. Blair scored again at 6:17 to take a 4-3 lead, but once again Magruder charged back and tied the game less than 30 seconds later. In the closing 1:30 of the first half the Blazers were able to pull ahead and get a little breathing room, thanks to two dazzling goals. With 1:21 remaining, Bruewlhide juked past two defenders and rocketed a shot from ten yards that the goalie had no chance in saving. Jones won the ensuing faceoff for Blair, blazed up the field and passed it off to one of the three forwards, who picked the defenders apart with gorgeous tic-tac-toe passing and scored just feet from the goal line.\n\nIn the second half, the Colonels tried to battle back, but were met with stiff resistance from Blair's defense and goalie. A Magruder forward ripped a low-to-high shot early in the third quarter that would have completely changed the game, but Cales made the key save. Tan scored again off a Magruder turnover at 9:37, then after winning the faceoff and controlling possession again, junior attacker Uro Lyi scored a minute and a half later to give the Blazers a commanding 8-4 lead.\n\nMagruder battled back in the remaining two thirds of the quarter, scoring only once but putting on the pressure and forcing the Blair defense to step up and make big plays, including an incredible stick save from Cales on a bouncing shot from only fifteen yards out.\n\nThe game slowly got out of hand for the Colonels in the fourth quarter. The Blazers controlled the ball for virtually the entire twelve minutes, thanks to a long streak of faceoff wins and precision passing and shooting from the offense. Though they faced an onslaught of shots, Magruder didn't give up a goal in the fourth until six minutes had ticked off the game clock, surrendering the first one of the quarter on a rocket from senior offensive middie Wonder Abor. \n\nAfter this goal, the floodgates opened up, with Blair scoring five more goals in the final five minutes of play, including two more from Tan, giving him a game high four goals. The score at the end was 15-5, but the Blazers on the field and in the crowd had been hyped long before the final whistle. Blair dominated possession in the final quarter, often scoring goals then proceeding to win the next faceoff and scoring again. \"Faceoffs are such a big part of lacrosse. Getting possession and starting with the ball after a stoppage really helps the offense get into a rhythm and takes pressure off our defense. It was crucial to the game.\" Jones said.\n\nWith the win, Blair boys lacrosse is now in reach of their first division title in school history, a huge feat for the athletes. But the team is always looking for more. Blair senior defenseman Sandy Hunter hopes the team can accomplish more. \"We are close to making history by winning the division, but we're looking farther ahead,\" Hunter said. \"Going the farthest we ever have in playoffs, that's what's next for us.\"\n\n<i>Next Matchup: The Blazers hope to continue their dominant play Friday April 29, as they take on the Springbrook Blue Devils (2-7-1) on the road.</i>", "section": 14, "cover": null, "authors": [905], "tags": []}}, {"model": "core.story", "pk": 13543, "fields": {"created": "2017-05-09T17:07:00Z", "modified": "2017-12-19T15:35:37.813Z", "title": "Disney remaking animated classics into live-action films", "description": "(no description)", "publishable": true, "published": 0, "views": 0, "lead": "(no lead)", "text": "The incredible success of the new \"Beauty and the Beast\" live action remake is just a taste of what Disney has in store for its fans in the next few years.\n\nEver since Disney released <i> 101 Dalmatians </i> back in 1996, they've known about the possibilities for live action movies. Amidst Disney's animated renaissance, during which time classics like <i>The Lion King, Aladdin, Toy Story</i> and <i> The Little Mermaid </i> were coming out, the live action version of <i> 101  Dalmatians </i> broke box office records and became the <a href = \"http://www.boxofficemojo.com/yearly/chart/mpaarating.htm?rating=G&yr=1996&p=.htm\"> top grossing family movie of the year </a>. Then, in 2010, <i> Alice In Wonderland </i> found similar success. The first live action Disney movie since <i> 101 Dalmatians </i> , it brought in <a href = \"http://www.boxofficemojo.com/movies/?id=aliceinwonderland10.htm\"> over a billion dollars</a> worldwide.\n<sco:embed type=\"image\" id=21108/>\n\nDisney has since woken up to this magic formula, striking gold on <i> Maleficent's </i> take on <i> Sleeping Beauty </i>  in 2014, <i> Cinderella </i> in 2015, and last year's <i> A Jungle Book </i>. While not all movies are guaranteed success, like the <i> Alice </i> sequel or <i> Pete's Dragon </i>, Disney has nevertheless found a way to bring in adults and teenagers who are nostalgically reminiscing about the stories they remember hearing as kids, while also gaining a whole new generation of Disney fans.\n\nRecently, <i> Beauty and the Beast </i> has been dominating the theaters with breathtaking CGI, a more modern script, a couple big-name actors, and nearly <a href = \"http://deadline.com/2017/03/beauty-and-the-beast-kong-skull-island-power-rangers-china-weekend-box-office-international-1202052444/\">$700 million in worldwide box office revenue</a>, despite only having been released on March 17. So, of course, Disney already has huge plans to monopolize on a ton of its old classics that everyone loves. Here's a list of Disney's top projects in the works:\n\n<i> Mulan </i> (2018)\n\nDisney has recently hired Niki Caro to direct this remake, scheduled for release in November of 2018. Little is known about the film, except it reportedly will not include any of the classic songs from the original animated picture, which already has a lot of fans worried.\n\n<i> The Little Mermaid </i>\n\nNo release date can be found as of yet for this film, but it is known that it will feature a mix of songs from the original and new songs made by Alan Menken, the creator of the original soundtrack, and Hamilton's Lin Manuel Miranda.\n\n<i> Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs </i>\n \n<i> Snow White </i> was Disney's first animated feature film, and the film that kickstarted their insanely popular princess franchise. There aren't that many details about <a href = \"https://moviepilot.com/p/live-action-snow-white-musical-disney-movie-remake/4137793> the upcoming film</a> just yet, but the movie will include new songs penned by Benj Pasek and Justin Paul, the lyrical geniuses behind the hit musical, <i>La La Land </i>\n\n\n<i> The Lion King </i>\n\nDisney is re-teaming up with Jon Favreau, the director who brought <i> A Jungle Book </i> to life for a <a href = \"http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/heat-vision/lion-king-live-action-movie-933335\">live action/CG reboot </a> of this instant classic. <i> Lion King </i>is considered by many to be the epitome of Disney's animated movies, and of animation as a whole, so this reboot could see incredible success, especially since they landed feature actors such as James Earl Jones and Donald Glover for the project earlier this year. \n\n<i> Cruella de Vil </i> \n\n<i> 101 Dalmatians </i> villain is getting her own <a href = \"http://www.seventeen.com/celebrity/movies-tv/news/a39942/emma-stone-stars-in-cruella/\">solo movie</a>. The adaption is set to follow Cruella in her early days and will star Emma Stone.\n\n<i> Aladdin </i>\n\nYes, a <a href = \"http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/heat-vision/disneys-live-action-aladdin-enlists-936881\">live action Aladdin</a> is officially in the works, and will be directed by Guy Richie. But, unlike some of the remakes we've seen so far, the new <i> Aladdin </i> film will not adhere strictly to the storyline you know and love. <i> Aladdin </i> will reportedly be an \"ambitious and non-traditional take\" on the animated film, with a non-linear format.\n\n<i> Peter Pan </i>\n\nAlmost nothing is known about <a href = \"http://www.seventeen.com/celebrity/movies-tv/news/a39693/the-next-disney-classic-to-get-a-live-action-remake-is/\">the new <i> Peter Pan </i> movie</a>, other than that it will be directed by David Lowery, from <i> Pete's Dragon </i>. Judging by the CGI used in that film, the crocodile's from this tale, like Tick Tock, are bound to be terrifying. Still, the new adaptation will have to be pretty good to top other adaptations from non-Disney studios, like 1991's <i> Hook </i>, and 2003's  <i>Peter Pan </i>.\n\n<i>Tinker Bell </i>\n\nPeter Pan's fairy sidekick is also slated to get her own origin story. It is reportedly called <i> Tink </i> and could star Reese Witherspoon as the lead.\n\n<i> Dumbo </i>\n\nThis adaption could have a darker feel than the original <i> Dumbo </i>, especially considering Tim Burton will direct it. Danny DeVito, Eva Green and Will Smith are reportedly all in talks for roles in the upcoming film.\n\n<i> Winnie the Pooh </i> \n\n<i> A Winnie the Pooh </i> movie is <a href = \"http://variety.com/2015/film/news/winnie-the-pooh-movie-disney-1201464876/\">in development right now</a> with Alex Ross Perry hired to write the adaptation.

A toaster oven sits on a countertop adjacent to a cooling loaf of bread. Nearby, students crowd around a table, shaking a mason jar full of cream, laughing. Chemistry is at work.\n\nThe Chemistry Cooking Club began during the 2015-2016 school year when Blair chemistry teacher Eric Prange thought it would be fun to have a course on food chemistry. \"I've always been interested in incorporating more food concepts into chemistry classes, and I thought one day it would be really cool to have a Chemistry of Cooking course,\" Prange explains. Several students liked the idea and created the Chemistry Cooking Club. Now in its second year, the club is still going strong - and cooking strong, too. \n<sco:embed type=\"image\" id=21111/>\nThe club whips up a variety of foods that incorporate chemistry concepts. But the club is nothing like a hard core chemistry class. Freshman Daphne Namir describes the club as engaging and relaxed. \"I really enjoy the club because it has such a great atmosphere, and everyone is pretty into it,\" Daphne says.\n\nDaniel Chen, a Chemistry Cooking Club member, recalls that the club's cooking endeavors include creme brulee, spherified juices (juice that is transformed into small semi-solid balls, like bubble tea), liquid nitrogen Dippin' Dots, homemade bread and butter, Asian scallion pancakes, avocado ice cream, caramels and cryofiltration (fruit juices that are filtered to be clear).  \n\nOccasionally, the club revises recipes in order to include more chemistry concepts. \"The goal of the Chemistry Cooking Club is to combine two things which a lot of us love: food and chemistry. The idea was to pick recipes to make but then to also have presentations about the chemistry behind it,\" Prange says.\n\nChemistry teacher Puja Luthra, Prange's co-sponsor, enjoys the use of science in a practical application. \"I think it's fun that we get to do a lot of cooking but that we also try to spend some time thinking about what the science is,\" Luthra says. \n\nMeetings are spent either planning for future recipes or actually cooking, and the planning process is vital to the overall success of a dish. \"Usually we come up with a plan and the first run-through fails,\" Prange adds. One skill that is key to the success of the Chemistry Cooking Club is patience. Members brainstorm an idea together, and often the most simple ideas prove to be the most practical. \"Sometimes the simpler answers are easier than the complicated ones,\" Prange notes.\n<sco:embed type=\"image\" id=21112/>\nMost recently, the club's second attempt at making Dippin' Dots ice cream proved successful.  Namir recalls the liquid nitrogen Dippin' Dots ice cream as her favorite dish ever made in the club. \"The whole process was really cool! It was really hectic, but in the end it turned out great!\" Daphne exclaims with a smile.\n\nWhat is the secret to making the tasty treat? Chen explains that liquid nitrogen will do the trick. \"First we had to acquire liquid nitrogen, but [Blair Chemistry teacher Tran Pham] happened to have some, so we borrowed it,\" Chen says. \n\nNext, the club members devoted a week to creating an apparatus that would drip ice cream batter into bowls. \"The apparatus was used to make sure the ice cream would drip, so we punched holes in the bottles and suspended them over a cardboard box with ceramic bowls in it,\" describes Chen. The apparatus \"didn't work well\" according to Prange, but the club didn't relent. \"Someone realized that we could take a cup, poke some holes through it, and the batter would drip through,\" Prange says with a smile. The vanilla, chocolate, peanut butter and buckeye flavors of Dippin' Dots ice cream proved to be an unforgettable cooking experience for the club. \"The ice cream took about two weeks to plan and make, and it turned out really well,\" Chen remarks. \n\nThe feeling of success after cooking a technical dish is what fulfills many members. \"That sense of accomplishment makes you feel like you can cook at home with not much trouble!\" Daphne says. \n\nFor Luthra, one memorable dish from the club was the juice spherification. \"The spherification was  really cool because that was something I'd never done before, so it was fun to try that for the first time with everybody,\" Luthra explains.\n<sco:embed type=\"image\" id=21113/>\nJuice spherification can be difficult - as Luthra notes, the finished product wasn't perfect. Basic spherification occurs by submerging a juice with sodium alginate in a bath of a calcium solution. The solution has to have just the right acidity in order to form a sphere.\n\n<b>The Logistics</b>\n\nThe Chemistry Cooking Club is student run, with Prange and Luthra acting as sponsors. Prange and Luthra facilitate the logistics of the club, like bringing in stand mixers and crock pots in order to make food in the building. Since Blair does not have a kitchen for student use, the Chemistry Cooking Club does the majority of food preparation at home and simply assembles the dishes at Blair. Chen says that the club looks to Prange and Luthra for their cooking and baking expertise. \"They are really knowledgeable about cooking and baking and help with a lot of useful tips and ideas,\" Chen says. \n\nLuthra's experience of cooking stems from her experience at home. \"I'm just a home cook. I really like to cook and help out the club,\" Luthra says with a smile.\n\nThe club hasn't planned for next year yet, but the end of this year is in sight. Luthra explains that the club might throw an end-of-year celebration dinner, or even make a recipe book. Both ideas are still in their earliest stages. \"We have been wanting to do an end-of -year-dinner where we pick out some of our favorite dishes from throughout the year,\" Luthra says.\n\nAnyone who's hungry after ninth period on Thursdays should head on over to the Chemistry Cooking Club.

Blair's competitive spirit kicked in and they scored four points in quick succession, bringing the score to 4-1. The Blazers and Falcons exchanged points, coming to a score of 10-6 Blazers. The Blazers' strong players, including senior Rourke Smith, repeatedly spiked the ball down for Blair. The Falcons were unable to retaliate and dropped the set, ending at 25-16.\n\nThe second set began with an increasingly competitive spirit. The Falcons were much more aggressive towards the Blazers than the first set. Though the Blazers remained in the lead, their defense and offense worked overtime to keep the set close. Several fumbles by the Blazers allowed the Falcons to get back into the game, only leading by one. \n\nSenior captain Lawrence Zhao served the Blazers to a big run, scoring points quickly and leading them on a 9-2 run, bring the score to 19-11.

After a failed serve, their momentum broke and the Falcons and Blazers began alternating points, until the score settled at 13-9 Blazers. The Blazers' strong performance continued, with great play by seniors Neal Sarkar, Elia Martin and captain Jesse Matthews. The Blazers took advantage of the Poolesville miscues to take the third set with a convincing score of 25-14.\n\nThe fourth set was dominated by Poolesville as they scored 11 points while Blair scored merely four. Smith brought out his spike again, breaking the momentum of the Falcons and bringing it back to within two.

With repeated spikes by Smith and exciting defense by Zhao and freshman Eric Hao, the seniors and the rest of the team thoroughly enjoyed the game and won while doing so. \"My goal tonight was not to win, just to let the seniors, who worked so hard, have a little fun, and they did.

The Norwegian Broadcasting Corporation wanted to draw in the demographic they lost the most to Netflix by creating a show based on what real teenagers in Oslo, Norway do, think and say.\n \nThe result was Skam, or Shame in English, which reveals a different character's experiences each season. Creator, writer and director Julie Andem conducted long interviews with target audience members each season to make the show and its characters as realistic and believable as possible. The characters are based off of real people and extend beyond the show- they have social media accounts that are active 24/7 to give viewers a fully immersive experience with the characters. Her work paid off because- without any promotion- millions of teens became obsessed with the series and broke viewership records in Norway, Denmark and Sweden. At one point over a fifth of the Norwegian population was tuned in to watch Skam.\n \nIt also captivated international audiences and versions of the show, with subtitles made by fans, started popping up in various languages. Clips of the show are released in real time on a website accompanied with screenshots of texts, and instagram posts which makes the suspense even more intense. Each character also has an instagram account with posts corresponding to the events of the show.\n<sco:embed type=\"image\" id=21151/>\nSkam has its own little world online and on social media, which connects teens to the characters. The show also takes place at a school that some of the actors attend in real life, which attracts some attention. Recently Nissen School had to close its doors to visitors because Danish tourists would swarm hallways in search of Skam characters. Classes would be disrupted by teens trying to find their favorite characters, so measures had to be taken.\n \nWhy are teens stalking characters that don't exist? Because it feels like they do. Everything in the show is what teens might go through in real life. Nothing is sugar-coated, exaggerated or censored. Personal problems, body image, homosexuality, cultural and religious identity, social issues, friendship, sex, drugs and addiction are all portrayed as they would occur in teens' lives and there is little adult involvement because these are issues teenagers are figuring out for themselves.\n \nEven when it was first released in 2015, there were no trailers or promotion because the creators wanted young people to find it and spread it on their own without adults. The show tells it like it is and, believe it or not, teaches teens invaluable lessons disguised with drama, parties and hookups.\n \nBecause the show is so raw and real, and the characters have such a strong media presence, teens become very invested in the outcomes of the show. When something particularly crushing happens, students have reportedly skipped school, spending the day on the Skam page or looking through their social media feeds for any information on what would happen next. Others have just stayed home to binge watch episodes, because once you start it's very hard to stop. They also lay awake at night, refreshing Skam's page in hopes of new texts or clips.\n \nIt's safe to say Skam has taken Norway (and several other countries) by storm.

The protesters marched for more than two hours from 3rd Street and Jefferson to the White House. Upon reaching the White House, the protesters participated in a peaceful sit-in and continued the march to the Washington Monument, where there was a rally with guest speakers.  \n\nAccording to D.C area public school coordinator and Blair graduate Sebi Medina-Tayac, this was not just a march for the environment. \"This march takes a social justice approach. It's a march that brings together diverse people to recognize how climate change is going to affect us.\" \n<sco:embed type=\"image\" id=21152/>\nThe march also aimed to include often overlooked minority groups, such as immigrants, people of color and indigenous groups.  While some people protested for generic environmental change, others marched with specific goals in mind. One group from Baltimore protested rising air pollution in the city, which is known to cause respiratory-related health issues.  These minority groups are often ignored, yet they are subjected to some of the worst environmental conditions. \n\nBlazers decided to get involved in the march for a variety of different reasons. Freshman Bianca Hernandez joined the march after hearing about it from a friend and wanted to help push for a solution, \"We've known about climate change and how our population has [harmed] the environment and the fact that we know this and don't do anything is a really big problem,\" Hernandez said. \n\nIn order to prepare for the march, many Blazers gathered at Blair on April 25 and made posters that promoted environmental change. The gathering was led by youth leaders such as Hernandez as well as Medina-Tayac.  \n\nMedina-Tayac, who has been involved with environmental issues since a young age, believes that it is very important for youth to get involved. \"I think as young people, we are going to be the ones to confront and face and fix these environmental issues...We're not responsible for all the things that have happened to the environment, but we are [now] responsible for how we take care of the environment,\" Medina-Tayac explained. \n\nOn April 28, the day before the march, Blazers met up with other high school and college students in order to participate in a youth convening that prepared the protesters with posters and chants.", "section": 3, "cover": null, "authors": [876], "tags": []}}, {"model": "core.story", "pk": 13549, "fields": {"created": "2017-05-17T18:31:00Z", "modified": "2017-12-19T15:35:37.961Z", "title": "Blair Robotics advances to World Championship Quarterfinals", "description": "Blazers excel in their first year qualifying for Worlds", "publishable": true, "published": 0, "views": 0, "lead": "Time and time again, the Blair Robotics Team came up just short.

They suffered a rough 2015 season, and a loss in the district finals ended their 2016 season early. But in 2017, the team finally broke through to the World Championships and made it all the way to the quarterfinals.\n\nAccording to senior Urjita Das, Robotics president, additional time spent designing the robot was key to this year's success. \"In previous years we always limited our design time to two days. This year, we took so long that I don't remember the exact time,\" she said. The team also created a computerized 3-D model of the robot design before building. \"This helped us make sure that all the parts came together properly before built in real life,\" Das explained.\n<sco:embed type=\"image\" id=21163/>\nThis year's challenge, <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EMiNmJW7enI\">\"Steamworks\"</a>, was to build a robot that could perform a variety of tasks, including collecting gears and placing them on a rung, shooting small balls into a basket and lifting itself up a tower by attaching to a rope. The alliance that scored the most points by completing these tasks would advance to the next round.\n\nJunior Kevin Peachey, the leader of the Drive subteam for Robotics, said that adapting to difficulties throughout the building process enabled them to handle the challenge well. One difficulty the team encountered was how they would place the gears on the rungs. \"We had problems with our passive gear mechanism, so we replaced it with an active gear mechanism,\" Peachey said.\n\nBlair Robotics was also successful this year because of its organization. The team used an app called <a href=\"https://basecamp.com/\">Basecamp</a> that allowed members to post designs, due dates and other news on a team message board. In the past, each subteam would create their own design which sometimes caused disagreements, according to junior Ankitha Durvasula, Mechanics subteam member. Now the entire team works together to make the design using Basecamp, which has led to a smoother design process.\n\nIn the World Championships, after a set of preliminary rounds, teams are selected to alliances, with the top eight preliminary point-scorers as alliance captains. Captains select two other teams and an alternate to an alliance and any teams not selected are eliminated. A strong early performance by the Blazers allowed them to be selected by the fifth alliance. Although they fell 1-2 in a best of three quarterfinal matchup, the team was ecstatic with its achievement and qualification for the World Championships.\n\nDespite performing so well this season, Peachey insisted that the best part of the year was the experience of going to St. Louis for the World Championships and meeting other top Robotics teams. \"The achievement was great, but the real value was going and talking to these amazing people from all over the world,\" he said.", "section": null, "cover": null, "authors": [899], "tags": []}}, {"model": "core.story", "pk": 13550, "fields": {"created": "2017-05-19T16:35:00Z", "modified": "2017-12-19T15:35:38.023Z", "title": "Students and staff devastated by death of Blair student", "description": "Freshman Mark Jean-Louis passes away unexpectedly", "publishable": true, "published": 0, "views": 0, "lead": "Blair offered counseling services today for staff and students due to the death of freshman student Mark Jean-Louis yesterday.

The Women's March was the biggest protest in American history, with millions of people raising their voices in solidarity. Even with its record-setting attendance and progressive message, the prevalence of white feminism overpowered other voices that matter.\n<sco:embed type=\"image\" id=21172/>\nWhite feminism is a set of feminist beliefs that excludes women of color, women of the LGBT community and women with disabilities. White feminism is a \"one size fits all\" style of feminism, where that one size is the middle class white woman. Their fight usually focuses on rape culture, equal pay and diminishing patriarchy. These are all issues that must be addressed to move forward; however, it is still problematic that they ignore the issues that plague women who don't fit the white, cis-gendered and straight mold, such as a more drastic wage gap for women of color and increased rates of violence towards transgender women.\n\nThere is nothing inherently wrong with a woman's inability to relate to the unique combinations of oppression faced by other women. It's easy for a middle-class white person to fail to understand issues of poverty in the black community despite being otherwise knowledgeable about issues of race. Similarly, able-bodied people don't easily notice ableism, white people don't easily notice racism and cis people don't easily notice transphobia. While not being able to relate is understandable, there is something wrong with not making an attempt to notice and to pay attention to injustices faced by other women. \n\nThe wage gap between men and women is about <a href=\"http://www.aauw.org/research/the-simple-truth-about-the-gender-pay-gap/\">20 percent</a>. Though a large part of the feminist movement is equal pay, many fail to recognize that the gap is even worse for women of color. On average, the wage gap for Hispanic women is about 46 percent and for black women it is 37 percent. The wage gap must be closed, but a huge problem at the root of this issue is the inability of women of color's troubles to be recognized.\n\nIn an <a href=\"http://bust.com/music/19363-solange-interview-sneak-peek.html\">interview</a> with BUST, Solange said, \"I want to see us fighting the fight for all women \u2014 women of color, our LGBTQ sisters, our Muslim sisters. I want to see millions of us marching out there for our rights, and I want to see us out there marching for the rights of women like Dajerria Becton, who was body slammed by a cop while she was in her swimsuit for simply existing as a young, vocal, black girl.\" White feminism is marked by a dangerous complacency in the systems of oppression that impact marginalized communities across the country. While white women remain vocal about reproductive rights, they are largely silent about the black men and women who die at the hands of police brutality. White women march to raise awareness about sexual assault, but they don't speak up about the high rates of transgender women who face abuse and violence.\n<sco:embed type=\"image\" id=21173/>\nTransgender women face the highest rates of violence and discrimination of all women. In 2015, there was a <a href=\"http://www.avp.org/storage/documents/mediarelease_2015_ncavp_hvreport.pdf\">20 percent</a> increase in reported hate violence homicides. 16 (67 percent) of those homicides victims were transgender people, 15 (62 percent) of them people of color and 13 (54 percent) transgender women of color. Hate violence against transgender women should be one of the  focuses of the feminist movement, but it seems to get overlooked as much of the movement is genital-based because many equate womanhood with having the unique female anatomical structures.\n\nInstead of white feminism, leaders and supporters of the feminist movement should practice intersectional feminism. If feminism is advocating for equality between men and women, intersectional feminism is the understanding that multiple aspects of a woman's identity, including race, religion and sexual orientation among others, compound and complicate oppression and marginalization. White feminists need to acknowledge that underrepresented women and domestic groups that have different histories and are at a tremendous disadvantage need to be included in the movement.\n\n<i>53 percent</i> of white women voted for Donald Trump. Whatever feminism means to white women voters, it seems to include a man accused of multiple sexual assaults and sought to punish those who choose to terminate their pregnancies. If white participants of the Women's March hope to enact real change in the name of women's rights, they must abandon white feminism altogether. Instead, they must use their platforms to help speak out for issues that affect women of different backgrounds as well as overarching issues that must be fixed to move forward as a society. Too long has the spotlight of feminist discourse been focused on rhetoric that does not help, but rather disadvantages, marginalized groups. Too long has the blueprint for feminism had a stake in white dominance, racism and classism.\n\nThe easiest way to move to a more intersectional approach? Start listening to and including various groups of women and their multi-layered facets and experiences in life.

A soft haze has settled around packed rooms that were nearly vacant only an hour ago. Bottles of alcohol adorn the messy counters and tables around which laughing teenagers converse. This is a typical night for many students who choose to party on the weekend, with the exception of a single individual standing by the door attentively. Dressed in all black, Bruce's imposing figure stands out. Bruce is a bouncer.  He's been tasked with keeping the party safe by preventing unwanted guests from getting inside, and taking care of whatever potentially harmful situations that may arise. \n \n\"I've been doing this for about a year and a half,\" says Bruce. Although he carries himself like a professional, he admits that he's \"only been paid a couple times\" for his services. Usually, it's done as a favor for close friends, like tonight. \n\nArriving at 7:30 p.m., Bruce's demeanor is cheerful. Joking around with friends, the air of authority that he'll have to adopt later has not presented itself yet. Valuables have already been moved out of plain sight, but Bruce paces around the main floor, making sure nothing important is missed. \"I always hope the night will be uneventful, because that means there weren't any problems,\" he muses, \"but usually there are people need to be kicked out or calmed down.\" At the moment there are only about ten other people in the house, but more begin to meander in after about an hour. \n<sco:embed type=\"image\" id=21181/> \nThe host has set a specific cap for how many people are allowed in the house, so Bruce is already aware he must prevent people from entering. Some of them have been explicitly banned. Some are just unlucky. Calmly and confidently blocking the door, he tells them that they must leave. As defiant as one may be, it's difficult to argue with Bruce, who emphasizes that what he's doing is never personal. \"I don't just kick people out, I try to make sure everyone is drinking water and sitting down when they need to,\" he explains about his duties throughout the night. \"The worst thing is probably having to stand out in the cold for so long,\" Bruce adds with a slight frown as he stands outside, in the cold. \n\nAt around 10:00 p.m., just as the party is getting started, two situations occur. First, a drunk girl punches another partygoer in the face, igniting a quickly escalating altercation. Bruce is able to rush in amidst the rapid insults traded between the two individuals and break things up before anything worse can happen. After leading them off in different directions, he is only afforded a moment of respite before getting to work again. \n \nWhen two squad cars approach the home, Bruce and the host announce that \"the cops are here,\" and usher as many people possible downstairs. Unfortunately, this is much easier said than done. Panicked teenagers begin to pour out through the side door and windows, dispersing throughout the otherwise quiet neighborhood. The police remain parked out in front and unbeknownst to most guests, are unable to come inside. Bruce steps out and approaches them. \n<sco:embed type=\"image\" id=21184/> \n\"Did you receive a noise complaint?\" Bruce asks them in the same placid tone he's maintained throughout the night. While speaking to the officers he intersperses respectful language such as referring to them as \"Sergeant\" in a conscious effort to win approval. \n\nIt's soon revealed that one of the neighbors called and claimed to have seen kids bringing alcohol inside. Although the police do not have a warrant (meaning they can't enter), they request for all the alcohol to be dumped on the front lawn. After a brief conversation between Bruce and the host, they both agree that complying with the cops is the best course of action. Over the course of about half an hour they proceed to pour out everything they can find, marinating the grass in handles of vodka and thirty-packs of beer. \n \n\"When the police show up it's important to try and remain as polite and professional as possible,\" Bruce advises after the cops have left without any further incidents. \"Don't talk back and just do what they say, but remember what your rights are so you can be as in control of the situation as possible,\" he says. Following this advice might have just saved the night for the party's host, who has managed to avoid a host of charges he may have otherwise been burdened with. After staying around for a while to make sure no other problems arise, Bruce finally gets ready to head home. \n \nFuture occurrences that involve the cops can be prevented. \"Don't invite a lot of people!\" Bruce emphasizes, \"too many people finding out about a party will always lead to problems, so as long as you avoid that whatever else that happens they'll be easier to manage.\" This is especially true for those who aren't lucky enough to have a friend like Bruce. Stepping out into the brisk winter night, it almost seems as if he doesn't realize quite how much of a blessing he's been. But for the many fun-seeking teens who have ended their night without a citation, including the host, Bruce's help has made all the difference between an unlucky night and an awful one.", "section": 9, "cover": null, "authors": [901], "tags": []}}, {"model": "core.story", "pk": 13553, "fields": {"created": "2017-05-30T17:46:00Z", "modified": "2017-12-19T15:35:38.092Z", "title": "Put good on, get good out", "description": "Ingredients to avoid in makeup and skincare", "publishable": true, "published": 0, "views": 0, "lead": "When it comes to personal care, there's no better reminder that if you put good in, you get good out.

For many, it comes as a no-brainer that if you use harmful products, you won't like the results. But it's important to know that despite this common sense, many still tend to mindlessly purchase products containing harmful ingredients, fooled by glamorous advertisements or clever labels. The truth is that any harmful ingredients can directly enter the bloodstream when the product is applied to skin or hair. It's time to pay attention to the ingredient labels and switch to more natural products that are more effective in the long run.\n \n<i>Sodium lauryl sulfate</i>\n \nThis chemical lurks in shampoos, body washes, face washes and toothpaste. Sodium lauryl sulfate has been linked to serious skin irritation, acne around the mouth and chin and even hormonal imbalances. Although this additive is <a href = \"http://www.livestrong.com/article/174367-dangers-of-sodium-lauryl-sulfate/\">derived from coconuts</a>, it can be contaminated with a toxic byproduct during the manufacturing process. \n \n<i>Butylated hydroxyanisole (BHA)</i>\n \nIf the National Toxicology Program labels this chemical as a possible carcinogen, you shouldn't have to think twice about avoiding it. The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) claims that consumption of BHA in small amounts is okay, but that's not a chance worth taking. Exfoliants and skin brighteners are likely to contain BHA and with overuse, can cause skin depigmentation. According to <a href = \"https://www.ewg.org/skindeep/ingredient/700740/BHA/#\">the Environmental Working Group</a>, other health concerns include endocrine disruption and organ toxicity.\n <sco:embed type=\"image\" id=21207/>\n<i>Parabens</i>\n \nThese chemicals are often used in cosmetics as preservatives to prevent bacterial growth within the product. The synthetic compound appears in the ingredients of many shampoos, conditioners, lotions, facial cleansers and scrubs. In studies from the past, parabens have been linked to endocrine disruption due to their ability to mimic the hormone estrogen. It's also been <a href = \"http://www.safecosmetics.org/get-the-facts/chemicals-of-concern/parabens/\">shown to</a> have ties to skin and breast cancer as well as reproductive and developmental disorders. Despite the FDA acknowledging these findings, they have not declared parabens as harmful. So the next time you find yourself in the cosmetics section of a store, remember to do yourself a favor and choose products labeled \"paraben free.\"\n \n<i>Polyethylene glycols (PEGs)</i>\n \nEver wondered what those colorful little beads are in a scrub, face wash or exfoliator? As petroleum-based compounds, these beads are supposed to be more gentle on the skin than ingredients found in organic products, such as walnut shells. But depending on how these beads were manufactured, they can be contaminated by ethylene oxide or 1,4-dioxane. According to the <a href = \"http://davidsuzuki.org/issues/health/science/toxics/chemicals-in-your-cosmetics---peg-compounds-and-their-contaminants/\">International Agency for Research on Cancer</a>, ethylene oxide is classified as a known carcinogen while the latter is only a possible carcinogen. These PEGs increase the permeability of the skin and allow for greater absorption of any harmful ingredients, which can cause irritation on damaged skin. \n \n<i>Natural skincare</i>\n \nIt's important to remember that the cosmetic industry is largely unregulated. Otherwise, many of these chemicals would not be present in the products people so readily purchase. You are responsible for your personal care and should take the time to read ingredient labels so you know which <a href = \"http://helloglow.co/ingredients-to-avoid-in-makeup-and-skincare-products/\">products to avoid</a> and which ones are <a href = \"http://www.elle.com/beauty/makeup-skin-care/news/g28431/best-green-beauty-products-2016/\">beneficial</a>.\n \nDoing some research online also gives you a chance to find products that are truly 100 percent natural and organic - and don't just claim to be.

Tumblr is a blogging site that allows users make notes and repost notes from other accounts on their dashboard, creating a whole website full of their thoughts. Students still use tumblr, but it is not as widespread as instagram is these days. Xanga was used when social media first started to become popular. Users were able to blog about their day with photos and status updates. It was one of the first blogging platforms to become mainstream back in 1999. These accounts were not meant to be private, everything shared was unfiltered and unedited (so perhaps it should have been, but that was before we all realized what should and should not be shared on social media). Finstas now compare in the same way where users share pictures and funny posts about their day with their followers. \n \nWhen comparing a finsta to a rinsta account there is a large discrepancy between the number of followers. While Tram's rinsta account has 444 followers, her finsta account has only 62. \"I can't let too many people know exactly what's happening in my head or else they'll all think I'm weird. My finsta account is only for the people who already know how weird I am,\" Tram says jokingly. \n \nSometimes, a finsta account can even become too public. And that's where a sinsta comes in (bear with me). Sinstas have even fewer followers and users share even deeper thoughts (as if that was possible). Some turn to sinstas when their finsta follower group grows too big. Honestly, I think two instagram accounts is enough for me,\" Tram says. Sinstas are more rare than finstas, which most Blazers seem to have. \n \nSocial media culture can be brutal. There is an unspoken competition about who has the most followers and who gets the most likes. \"I always feel the pressure whenever I post something. There's stress with every like that I get a notification for. It's not the same for my finsta,\" Tram explains. The ability to be raw and real on a finsta account relieves the pressure for likes on the posts. \n \nThis fad isn't expected to end any time soon. Although sinstas might be taking it too far, finstas allow Blazers to feel free to be themselves in their posts. They can mass share their moments with their friends all at once and blog about their day. A personal digital diary just for them and their 60 closest friends.", "section": null, "cover": null, "authors": [873], "tags": []}}, {"model": "core.story", "pk": 13555, "fields": {"created": "2017-05-31T12:18:00Z", "modified": "2017-12-19T15:35:38.172Z", "title": "A few reasons why not ", "description": "Issues with representation of mental health make \"13 reasons why\" problematic", "publishable": true, "published": 0, "views": 0, "lead": "(no lead)", "text": "\"I'm about to tell you the story of my life \u2013 more specifically, why my life ended. And if you're listening to this tape, you're one of the reasons why.\" \n \nThese are some of the final words said by Hannah Baker, the main character of the new Netflix series \"13 Reasons Why,\" before her violent suicide. Based on the novel by Jay Asher, the new show is taking Netflix, the Twittersphere and Internet by storm. Although the show is acclaimed by some for its important message of kindness, it does not address mental illness and how mental illness contributes to Hannah's untimely death. \n \nThe show follows the suicide of fictional high school sophomore Hannah Baker and the events leading up to it. Before she commits suicide, Hannah records 13 cassette tapes, each citing a different person for causing her death. Hannah plans to have each of the 13 people listen to all the tapes and then pass them onto the next person. Clay Jensen, number 11 on the tapes, is Hannah's crush, who slowly (and heart wrenchingly) makes his way through the tapes and learns that Hannah was bullied, slut shamed and was raped, before she died.\n \nMany have praised the show for showing how people's actions affect others and lead them to take drastic measures to escape the pain that others have caused them. However, the show has come under fire because of its depiction (or lack thereof) of mental illness and its generally problematic portrayal of how a suicidal person looks and acts. \n \n<b> 1 - Suicide is showed as the solution to a problem </b>\nA major issue with \"13 Reasons Why\" is that suicide is portrayed as the only solution to Hannah's problems. Hannah is struggling with making friends and being bullied, but the show makes it seem as if suicide is the only way that Hannah can solve her problems. \nThe show portrays <a href=\"https://www.usatoday.com/story/opinion/2017/04/17/suicide-13-reasons-why-mental-illness-column/100562428/\"> kindness and love </a> as the only way to save Hannah's life. Mental illness cannot be cured with love and kindness alone, resources like school counselors, therapy, suicide hotlines or even talking to a friend about how she was feeling could have helped Hannah, but the show never explores these options.\n<sco:embed type=\"image\" id=21210/>\n<b> 2 - Mental illness is never explicitly discussed</b>\n<a href= \"http://depts.washington.edu/mhreport/facts_suicide.php\"> 90 percent </a> of those who commit suicide suffer from mental illness, yet depression or mental illness is never even mentioned in \"13 Reasons Why.\" None of the other characters suspect that Hannah is going to commit suicide, because she does not exhibit any of the warning signs of someone who is suffering from depression or suicidal thoughts. In a show that is all about suicide and supposedly how to prevent it, it is ridiculous that mental illness or the warning signs of <a href =\"https://thetab.com/uk/leeds/2017/04/11/13-reasons-insult-anyone-mental-health-issues-31188\"> of suicidal intentions </a> are never mentioned. Without seeing these signs no one could've known her intentions. The show appears to romanticize suicide by never showing how ugly mental illness is and instead shows Hannah as someone who is easily hurt and dramatic. \n \n<b> 3 - Hannah blames everyone in her life for her own actions </b>\nSuicide is an individual action, yet Hannah blames 13 different people for hers. In the end, suicide is not caused by other people. As harsh as it sounds, it was Hannah's choice to kill herself. While the people who slut shamed her and abused her deserve to be punished for their actions, they also don't deserve to have her death on their hands when she was the one who made the final decision. In many cases of suicide, those who were close to the victim or knew the victim<a href=\"https://www.usatoday.com/story/opinion/2017/04/17/suicide-13-reasons-why-mental-illness-column/100562428/\"> feel guilt. </a> In the show, Clay especially feels guilty for Hannah's death, even though he is one of the few people who supported her. This guilt leads him to make decisions he normally wouldn't like sneaking out, lying and even trying to get revenge on those who hurt Hannah. \n \nHannah creating these tapes that specifically blame other people only adds to that guilt and creates a lot of turmoil for those on the tapes. The choice Hannah made was hers alone: having people listen to those tapes and hearing her blame them for her death is wrong. It makes it seem as if Hannah committed suicide for attention and revenge. \n \n<b> 4 - The graphic depictions of suicide and rape are dangerous </b>\nAlthough Netflix does provide trigger warnings at the beginning of the episodes, that does not take away from the brutality of the scenes. Even to those who would not necessarily be triggered by the scenes, they are shocking and gruesome to watch. According to <a href =\" https://www.vox.com/culture/2017/4/18/15275846/13-reasons-why-male-gaze-voyeurism-rape-suicide-contagion\"> Victor Schwartz</a>, a psychiatry professor at New York University and Chief Medical Officer of the suicide prevention program the <a href =\"https://www.jedfoundation.org/\"> JED Foundation </a>, which focuses on preventing suicide and promoting mental health, not only is this scene unsettling to watch, it can be dangerous as well. \"Research shows us that the more obvious, florid, dramatic, and explicit the portrayal is, as disturbing as it is to most of us, there's the potential that for some people who see it, who are really struggling with something, this winds up being in some way strangely appealing.\" Schwartz says. \n \nAs a result of the depiction of suicide in \"13 Reasons Why,\" the <a href=\u00a8http://www.nasponline.org/resources-and-publications/resources/school-safety-and-crisis/preventing-youth-suicide/13-reasons-why-netflix-series-considerations-for-educators\u00a8> National Association of School Psychologists </a> has released a statement saying that they do not recommend that the show is viewed by anyone who is vulnerable or having suicidal thoughts and that the show does not do enough to emphasize that most suicides are a result of mental illness. After viewing Hannah's successful suicide, those who may be at risk of committing suicide themselves could see her suicide as a how to guide and commit the act themselves. \n \nThe show is already starting to have <a href= \"https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/answer-sheet/wp/2017/04/29/school-superintendent-students-are-harming-themselves-and-citing-13-reasons-why/?utm_term=.207a317a1176\"> negative effects </a> on young adults. One Florida school superintendent sent a letter out to parents saying that their district has seen a recent uptake in harmful behavior such as self-harm and suicide threats in the wake of the show. The school system has seen more than a dozen episodes of self-harm or threats of self-harm that specifically cited the show when asked about their behavior. \n \n\"13 Reasons Why\" is a great conversation starter and has already led more schools to discuss mental illness and suicide prevention. However, the way that the show depicts Hannah's suicide without the mention or portrayal of any mental illness makes her seem vengeful and petty, which is generally untrue of those who commit suicide. It does not do enough to show that there are other options for those who are suffering. Though a captivating and well told story, \"13 Reasons Why\" should be viewed carefully as it does not truly portray what mental illness looks like and can be harmful to those at risk. The show does have some merits and should not be completely done away with. However, additional steps should be taken to ensure that the message of the show is clearer and not misconstrued as a romanticism of suicide. The conversations that the show creates about suicide and rape do not outweigh the costs, especially when the cost could be exactly what the show sought out to prevent--the death or harm of another young person. \n \n<i> If you are contemplating suicide, please call the suicide prevention hotline at 1-800-273-8255 or reach out to a trusted family member, friend or counselor.

Others opt for complete freedom, letting their children party and take care of their own business without oversight. Most high school parents fall somewhere between these two extremes, and it begs the question: how much parental involvement is just right?\n\nMany high school students believe that their parents are too overbearing. For junior Annie Zhou, parental involvement is a necessary evil. \"My parents check my grades often,\" Zhou explains. \"I sometimes have to remind them that grades are not final 'til the end of the quarter. They get worried every time I do badly on a test.\" While having another set of eyes on interim report cards can be daunting, it can also have a positive influence. \"I think that parents should be vigilant of their kids. It will push them to try harder,\" continues Zhou.\n   <sco:embed type=\"image\" id=21213/>\nA little push doesn't hurt, but some students are starting to feel the consequences of too much oversight. According to <a href=\"http://healthland.time.com/2013/02/22/hover-no-more-helicopter-parents-may-breed-depression-and-incompetence-in-their-children/\">Time Magazine</a>, so-called \"helicopter parenting\" has been proven to cause depression in youth. Some Blair students are watched more closely than others by their parents.\n\nSophomore Avery Brooks appreciates her parents' involvement in her life, but concedes that it sometimes gets a bit over-the-top. \"They're super involved in me and my siblings' lives. They know where we are and we're required to update them every so often of where we are and what we're doing,\" Brooks says. \"I can't really lie about where I'm going because they can use 'Find My iPhone' to see where I am whenever they want.\" Technology like phones and GPS trackers has made it easier than ever for parents to keep tabs on their children.\n \nNot all Blazers have the same experience when it comes to parental involvement. Senior Camille Torfs-Leibman describes a family that loves and supports her, but ignores Edline and trusts her to make her own decisions. \"My parents have always trusted that I put enough pressure on myself to do well. I really like being responsible because it allows for me to have wiggle room and recuperate after a bad day without someone breathing down my back,\" Torfs-Leibman says. Not all teenagers, however, are driven enough to keep track of their own lives.\n  <sco:embed type=\"image\" id=21212/>\nJust like with overbearing parents, there is a more extreme end of the spectrum. Silver Spring came into the <a href=\"http://wjla.com/news/local/silver-spring-parents-charged-with-child-neglect-for-allowing-kids-to-walk-home-alone-112094\">national spotlight</a> in 2015 thanks to the \"free range kids.\" Danielle and Alexander Meitiv were charged with child neglect for allowing their six and ten year old children to walk home alone. Similarly, there are Blair parents who let their kids drink and smoke without punishment.\n\nThe importance of parental involvement or lack thereof extends beyond the walls of academia. For junior Lillian Carranza, her parents most closely monitor her religious life. \"My parents are from Guatemala, and it's hard for them to accept sometimes that I don't want to go to church. They blame everything that happens on not going to church,\" describes Carranza. \"We go to church usually on Saturday and Sunday. I don't have a problem with going, but sometimes I don't have time. I wish they wouldn't try to shove their beliefs down my throat.\"\n \nChildren are inclined to reject the religion of their family, and often go on to leave the church. According to <a href=\"http://www.familylife.com/articles/topics/parenting/foundations/spiritual-development/why-do-so-many-kids-leave-the-church\">Family Life</a>, 70% of children have left their parents' faith by the time they graduate college. For many kids, anything that they are forced to undergo without agreeing to it is anathema.\n \nWhat does this all mean? There are too many conflicting viewpoints and stories to determine what the ideal amount of parental involvement is for a high school student. Different teens need different levels of help with things like schoolwork and social life. The most important thing is honesty. If both parties tell the truth and don't expect too much from one another, an easier relationship between parents and kids can develop. After all, a small concession goes a long way.", "section": 9, "cover": null, "authors": [878], "tags": []}}, {"model": "core.story", "pk": 13558, "fields": {"created": "2017-06-14T16:58:00Z", "modified": "2017-12-19T15:35:38.238Z", "title": "Bitten by the bug bug", "description": "Entomology class offers Blazers a unique opportunity", "publishable": true, "published": 0, "views": 0, "lead": "There are roughly <a href=\"https://www.si.edu/Encyclopedia_SI/nmnh/buginfo/bugnos.htm\">10 quintillion</a> (10,000,000,000,000,000,000) bugs on the planet earth and <a href=\"https://www.quora.com/How-many-square-feet-of-dry-ground-is-on-Earth\">150 million</a> square kilometers of dry land.

That means that there's roughly 20,000 insects per square foot. While that might make some people's skin crawl, the students in Elizabeth Duval's ninth period entomology class are an exception to the rule.\n \nThe culminating class project in entomology is to amass a collection of thirty unique insect species, dead and pinned under glass. That's 30 creepy-crawly bugs caught individually, by hand or by net. Suffice it to say, entomology is not for the faint of heart. After getting past the fear of insects, students need to come to terms with the fact that, as many bugs as there are in the world, catching thirty different ones is no easy feat.\n \nAfter getting past the simple varieties, the ants, the flies and the beetles, these critters become exponentially harder to track down. Genetic traits developed over hundreds of years come into play, like stingers, pincers and camouflage. How do you bag a butterfly without crushing its wings? How do you pocket a pill bug before it burrows into the ground? How do you wrangle a wasp without getting the crap stung out of your hand?\n \nSenior Elia Martin's strategy is simply to get lucky and get ahold of an insect when it's at its weakest. \"One of my first exciting catches was in the woods on a Saturday morning. I was hacking at a rotting log when I uncovered four wasps,\" describes Martin. \"At first I jumped back, but once I got over my surprise and made sure they were too sleepy to sting me, I scooped them into my jar, and was welcomed by angry buzzing soon after.\"\n <sco:embed type=\"image\" id=21214/>\nOne of the keys to the class is always being ready grab a bug at any moment. Midway through a pickup basketball game, walking home from school or even playing a round of golf can lead to a bug catching expedition. Senior Jesse Matthews' favorite find came in one such locale. \"My best catch was a shield bug on hole 13 of the Northwest Branch Gold Course. I didn't have a net or a kill jar or anything, so I had to cover it with a paper drinking cup and hold the cup closed for the rest of the round,\" laughs Matthews. \"I only went eight over par on the hole, too, so that's great.\"\n \nNot all bugs, however, are created equal. Everybody has twenty ants, a bunch of flies, and a couple of common beetles. It's the rarer stuff, like colorful butterflies or other exotic insects, that really separate one student's collection from another.\n \nThat's where the economy of entomology comes into play. According to Matthews, the value of a bug varies considerably day to day. \"Bug trading is a crazy economy because a bug like a damselfly can be worth three or four other bugs one day, but then someone hits the jackpot and catches like twenty damselflies the next day and they're cheap as dirt,\" explains Matthews. \"It's all about restricting the supply.\"\n \nEven when the bug is dead and pinned in Duval's closet, the collector isn't out of the woods yet. One student accidentally left a beetle which was still alive in his box overnight. When he came back the next day, he was welcomed by mangled bug parts, the result of the beetle's angry rampage against the rest of its kind.\n \nWhile searching down and pinning bugs is the focal point of the class, entomology also offers the opportunity to learn about more about the fundamentals of bug science. Discovering different insect species and body segments are paramount to the process. According to senior Steven Dunne, the class learned a lot of these subjects through fun games. \"We played Cranium and charades, but with twists to relate them more to insects,\" recalls Dunne. \"That was definitely one of the more fun parts of the semester.\"\n \nOne the class is over, students are left with an awesome trinket to hang onto for the rest of their lives. \"The class has a great final product in the form of our insect collections,\" explains Matthews. \"We can keep our collections and admire them for years to come.\" This part of the class is more rewarding for those whose bug collections weren't eaten from within, but, hey, we can't all be winners.\n \nBlair is full of fun off-color classes like entomology. Take a semester of horticulture, or entomology, or world drumming. You might come away with a life skill, or a glass box full of insects. And next time, don't assume that the kid waving a giant net through the air after school is crazy. He might just be looking for another bug for his collection.", "section": null, "cover": null, "authors": [878], "tags": []}}, {"model": "core.story", "pk": 13559, "fields": {"created": "2017-06-14T18:11:00Z", "modified": "2017-12-19T15:35:38.252Z", "title": "Cheap Eats in Silver Spring", "description": "A beginner's guide to dining on a budget", "publishable": true, "published": 0, "views": 0, "lead": "You're walking down the street as the pangs of hunger begin to settle in, but there are only a few meager bills in your pocket.

Everyone's been there. Sometimes hunger strikes at the most inopportune time. This can lead the weaker-willed, or perhaps just less experienced, individual to resort to such unsavory methods of satiation as McDonald's or 7-Eleven. But no longer. Here are a few fine establishments in the Blair area that provide quick and appetizing meals at modest prices, so no one will ever have to suffer through a greasy abomination again just because they're a few dollars short. \n \n<b>Big Greek Cafe </b> <sco:embed type=\"image\" id=21217/>\nBefore embarking on this feta-fueled Odyssey, the melodious music and clean interior of the Big Greek Cafe in Downtown Silver Spring provide a pleasant setting to enjoy a meal. The presentation of the gyro is typical of most fast food places, but distinguishes itself with a cube of feta and two peppers, to be eaten with the sandwich. Upon the first bite, the overall saltiness of the is slightly overpowering, as the condiments are unevenly distributed, with only meat and pita bread at the front. However after making my way further through the tomatoes, onions and tzatziki (a yogurt sauce) balance out this saltiness and complement the strong flavors of the well-seasoned meat. This might be one of the cheapest and most convenient places to eat in Silver Spring on Wednesdays, where the Big Greek Cafe has a weekly $5 gyro deal. For a mere Abraham Lincoln one can enjoy a complete meal without sacrificing food quality at this popular local spot.\n \n<b>Negril </b> \nAnother downtown Silver Spring establishment, Negril, is worth the skinny sidewalk and lack of legal nearby parking. Even a modest sum (of about $4) can buy you a full meal of a beef patty and coco bread. This might seem like a bit of a carb-overload, but the soft, fluffy bun pairs well with the crisp and flaky pastry which houses a spicy beef filling. If you're feeling a little more opulent, you can splurge and buy the jerk chicken sandwich for $6. A plentiful helping of deliciously seasoned chicken is paired with crisp lettuce and a sweet poppy seed dressing, all in a piece of coco bread. Though larger and more filling than the beef patty, this sandwich feels lighter, perhaps due to the lack of anything fried. When in downtown Silver Spring, it's hard to resist this longtime staple of Blair students. \n \n<b>El Pollo Rico </b>\nIf you find yourself in Wheaton and needing to either feed yourself (or an entire family), El Pollo Rico is the place to go. For only $6.30 you can help yourself to a quarter of a chicken and two sides which include fries, white rice, red beans, tortillas and coleslaw. There are plenty of Peruvian chicken places near Blair, but El Pollo Rico blows the competition out of the water. Juicy, perfectly seasoned, just crispy enough and always fresh; this is some life-changing chicken. But the real star of their menu is the the Family Deal. One whole chicken with your choice of three generous sides and eight sauces, all for $21. Able to feed a mob of starving people, or one <i>really</i> hungry individual, the Family Deal makes El Pollo Rico one of the best bangs for your buck in the area. \n \n<b>Mi La Cay</b> <sco:embed type=\"image\" id=21219/>\nAnother great and affordable Wheaton spot, albeit a less well-known. Mi La Cay is a Vietnamese restaurant offering pho, banh mi and many other delicious dining options. However, the most affordable item on the menu is the banh mi ($6), which is perfect to grab when you're strapped for cash but still craving a filling meal. Banh mi is a type of sandwich that features your choice of pork, beef, or chicken with jalapenos, carrots, cilantro and cucumbers all nestled in between two pieces of fluffy french bread. The pickled and seasoned vegetables balance out the meat and bread, creating an interesting combination of both light and heavy as well as cool and hot. The savory seasoning especially lends itself to the pork but is tasty on all three options and is made all the better with the addition of jalapenos to create some more complexity in the flavorful sandwich. A Vietnamese restaurant might not be the first place one may think of when searching for an affordable sandwich, but after one visit, Mi La Cay will quickly become a regular lunch and dinner spot.", "section": 44, "cover": null, "authors": [901], "tags": []}}, {"model": "core.story", "pk": 13560, "fields": {"created": "2017-06-14T18:12:00Z", "modified": "2017-12-19T15:35:38.281Z", "title": "Blair's spring sports teams excel in record-breaking postseason ", "description": "Lacrosse teams win region and track crowns a state champ", "publishable": true, "published": 0, "views": 0, "lead": "Blair had a postseason for the ages this spring, with historic success across several of the nine spring sports.", "text": "Blair had a postseason for the ages this spring, with historic success across several of the nine spring sports.

Girl's lacrosse posted a 6-6 regular season record, but they beat Northwood, Springbrook and Paint Branch before dominating Eleanor Roosevelt 17-9 in a region finals victory. Both lacrosse teams fell to perennial powerhouse Severna Park in the state semifinals to end their impressive postseason runs.\n \nBoy's lacrosse midfielder Calvin Bruwelheide pointed to the Blazers' veteran lineup as crucial to their postseason prowess. \"We had an extremely experienced team consisting of 17 seniors. They definitely gave us the motivation to succeed being that it was their last year at Blair,\" he said. \n\nGirl's lacrosse defender Mia Rothberg also thought that strong senior leadership was important to her team. \"Our captains [Elizabeth Cove and Claudia Burlington] were really good and put in a lot of effort,\" she said. Rothberg also pointed out that both lacrosse teams had a good opportunity to do well this year because they were in a division with Prince George's County teams, who were in their first year of having lacrosse programs.\n<sco:embed type=\"image\" id=21215/>\nThe lacrosse teams were not the only spring sports teams to end their year on a high note. Baseball completed a 14-8 season with hard-fought playoff wins over Richard Montgomery, Bethesda Chevy-Chase and Walter Johnson, before a heartbreaking 3-2 loss to Northwest in the region finals. Softball also defeated Richard Montgomery and BCC to win their division, but fell to rival Northwest 14-11 in their final game. \n \nUnlike the lacrosse teams, softball had a history of postseason success, having advanced to the state semifinals in 2016. However, according to first baseman Maggie Gray, this didn't dilute their excitement about their 2017 performance. \"We definitely had some games where we were shaky and didn't play our best, but towards the end of the season we really came together as a team,\" she said. \n \nBlair track and field also had several outstanding performances at the state championships to finish off their year. Morgan Casey won the girl's 800m run with a blazing time of 2:16.22. The boy's and girl's 4x800m relay teams placed fourth and sixth respectively, while Enoch Owumi took third in the boy's 100m dash with a speedy 10.99 second sprint. Other notable results included Josephine Brane-Wright's fourth place finish in the girl's 3200m run and Thierry Siewe Yanga's fifth place in the boy's 800m.\n \nOther performances of note were solid seasons by boy's tennis and boy's volleyball. Boy's tennis finished their year with a 7-4 record, while volleyball finished 9-4 including a playoff win over BCC.\n \nAlthough each spring sports team performed well individually, it was especially exciting for the teams to experience success simultaneously. Bruwelheide agreed, saying, \"It was lots of fun to watch all of spring sports teams compete this year.\"\n \n<i>Editor's Note: Morgan Casey is a member of the Silver Chips Online Photo Staff.</i>", "section": null, "cover": null, "authors": [899], "tags": []}}]
